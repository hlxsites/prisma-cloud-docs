== Get Started with OIDC JIT

Prisma Cloud offers System Administrators the ability to auto-provision users using the Open ID Connect (OIDC) Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration. This option allows you to manage user identities outside of Prisma Cloud in your organization’s Identity Provider (IdP). Configure OIDC Just in Time (JIT) provisioning to create new Prisma Cloud users on an as needed basis, when users with the appropriate entitlements log in using OIDC SSO. 

Complete the steps below on the Prisma Cloud console and your IdP to set up OIDC JIT provisioning:

[.procedure]
. Log in to Prisma Cloud using an account with System Administrator privileges to configure SSO.
. On your Prisma Cloud tenant select *Settings > Access Control > SSO* and click *OIDC*.
. Navigate to *Just in Time (JIT) Provisioning* and select *Enable*.

. Enter information for the users you would like to provision in the following fields:
.. *Scopes* - "email", "profile", and "openid" or are always enabled. Specify additional scopes if required to expose the *Role Claim Name* defined below.
.. *Role Claim Name* - Specify a claim under which Prisma Cloud Role names will be exposed for the purposes of authorization. If no Role Claim Name is entered, a “groups” claim will be used by default. Follow the instructions below for IdP specific configuration:

... *Microsoft Azure* 
.... On the Azure portal, navigate to *Manage > Token Configuration > Add groups claim > Edit groups claim > Customize token properties by type* and set all token types to use "sAMAccountName".

+
.... Add “groups” to the Scopes defined in Step 4 above.  

. *Default Role* - Authenticated users that do not present a valid Prisma Cloud Role name under the *Role Name Claim* are granted access to this role if specified. 

[NOTE]
====
If specified, all authenticated users will have access to the Default Role. If default access for all authenticated users is required, a read-only Prisma Cloud Role is recommended. While not prohibited, use of a System Administrator Role is strongly discouraged.
