|DESCRIPTION

|*_AWSCloudAccount.orgHierarchyNames() RQL Function for AWS Assets*

//RLP-127530, RLP-110106

|A new `_AWSCloudAccount.orgHierarchyNames()` RQL function is available to enumerate the organization memberships for a given asset. You can use this function to refer to the list of complete Organization Units (OUs) in your account ownership hierarchy in order to compare whether any of the OUs or parent OUs match with the targeted list values. Here are a few examples:

* `config from cloud.resource where api.name = ‘aws-ec2-describe-security-groups’ AND json.rule = _AWSCloudAccount.orgHierarchyNames() intersects (“OU4”)`

* `config from cloud.resource where api.name = ‘aws-ec2-describe-vpcs’ and json.rule = ‘_AWSCloudAccount.orgHierarchyNames() intersects (ou-u00k-th4guvk9, r-u00k)’`

* `config from cloud.resource where api.name = ‘aws-ec2-describe-vpcs’ AND json.rule = _AWSCloudAccount.orgHierarchyNames() intersects (“OU4") as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = ‘aws-ec2-describe-subnets’ AND json.rule = _AWSCloudAccount.orgHierarchyNames() intersects (“OU4”) as Y; filter ‘$.X.vpcId equals $.Y.vpcId’; show Y;`

* `config from cloud.resource where api.name = ‘aws-ec2-describe-security-groups’ AND json.rule = _AWSCloudAccount.orgHierarchyNames() does not intersect (“OU1") and _AWSCloudAccount.orgHierarchyNames() exists`

|*AppDNA for Application Context*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

//RLP-104999

|AppDNA helps you center your security strategy around your applications, the most vital construct in your cloud estate. https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/assets/pdf/app-dna-lga.pdf[AppDNA] intelligently groups assets in a manner that exposes their relationships, in the context of application development. AppDNA helps you:

* Discover applications based on Kubernetes Namespace and assign a Display Name, Owner, Environment, and Business Criticality.

* Leverage the application context to Investigate the alert which adds an additional factor for risk prioritization based on the business criticality of an application.

* Prioritize risks based on criticality and impact on applications, and associated assets.


|*Support for Onboarding IBM Cloud*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

//RLP-101176
//https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/ibm-onboarding-lga.pdf

|Prisma Cloud allows you to https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/assets/pdf/ibm-onboarding-lga.pdf[onboard and protect] your resources deployed on the IBM cloud infrastructure from a single console. Gain complete visibility and control over potential risks within your IBM cloud infrastructure across all the Multi-Zone Regions (MZR).

You can now manage vulnerabilities, ensure compliance, and provide runtime defense for your resources in the IBM cloud.


|*Asset Tag Filter in Asset Inventory*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

//RLP-70205 - Possible GA in Q4

//https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/asset-inventory-resource-tag-filter-lga.pdf

|A new https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/assets/pdf/asset-inventory-resource-tag-filter-lga.pdf[Asset Tag] filter is now available in the Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory, which allows you to focus on assets based on the resource tags present. Once you filter based on the Asset Tag, the Asset Inventory will display only the assets that contain the Asset Tags you specified.


|*Resolved Alert Notification to External Integrations*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

//RLP-71649, RLP-83106

|The alert notification system is enhanced to send resolved notifications to external integrations such as ServiceNow or Jira (integrations that support the state change) when you delete a cloud account or update an alert rule on the Prisma Cloud administrative console.  For example, when the cloud account or the alert rule associated with an open alert is deleted, the alert status is updated as resolved on Prisma Cloud and the corresponding resolved notification will be sent to the supported integration channels where the open alert notification was sent.
