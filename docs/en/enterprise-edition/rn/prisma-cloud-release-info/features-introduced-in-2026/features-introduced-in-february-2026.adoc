|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Azure Storage Accounts Read Scope Lock*
//RLP-157660

|Updates to Prisma Cloud include a fix to address the handling of Azure Storage accounts restricted by a read scope lock. Prisma now classifies read scope locks as an **Authorization limitation**. Resources affected by a read scope lock can no longer be ingested. Any previously ingested resources that later become scope-locked will automatically be marked as deleted.

2+|*Policy Updates—Metadata*

|*Azure VM disk configured with overly permissive network access*
//RLP-157702

|*Updated Description–* Policy description is updated to convey the "defense-in-depth" perscpective.

Azure Virtual Machine disks configured with public network access pose a secondary security risk in the event of a host-level breach. While disk access is restricted by identity, enabling a public network access creates a reachable path that can be exploited if the attached Virtual Machine is also compromised.

Azure Virtual Machine disks are storage resources attached to Virtual Machines. When disk public network access is enabled, it provides an internet-routable access for the disk data. If an attacker successfully compromises the attached VM or its associated credentials, this public configuration allows them to bypass internal network perimeters and exfiltrate or manipulate disk data directly from the internet.

The impact of this configuration includes simplified data exfiltration and unauthorized modification following a system compromise. By restricting access to private or trusted networks, you ensure that even if a VM is breached, the data remains shielded from the public internet. This best practice enforces a layered 'defense-in-depth' strategy.

To mitigate this risk, disable public network access for all Azure Virtual Machine disks. Utilize Azure Private Link or restricted Disk Access settings to ensure that storage traffic remains within the private network. Regularly review and audit network configurations to identify and remediate any disks that remain exposed to public routing.
