| *Lifecycle Support Update*

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.00.169]

//CWP-61282

| Prisma Cloud officially guarantees backward compatibility with up to two previous major versions (N-2).

Although the support lifecycle remains unchanged, starting from version 33.xx, Prisma Cloud will not restrict the usage of Defender versions or REST API calls from up to three major releases before the current version (upto N-3 major releases).

For example, with the current version at 33.xx, API calls and Defenders from version 30.xx will be allowed. However, support and complete backward compatibility is guaranteed for the 32.xx and 31.xx releases.

|*Description*

|*Package Operational Risks*

tt:[Secure the Source]
//BCE-33800

tt:[24.9.2]

| https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/application-security/visibility/sbom/sbom#package-op-risk[Package Operational Risk] assesses the operational risk and potential impact of each open-source package in your codebase. This analysis results in package operational risk severity levels categorized into *High*, *Medium*, and *Low*. By prioritizing risks based on these categories, you can effectively focus remediation efforts on the most critical issues.

|*DSPM Integration with Attack Path and Asset Inventory*
//RLP-149791

tt:[Secure the Data]

tt:[24.9.2]

|If an Attack Path has access to a data store, you can now view the sensitivity, sensitivity label, data types, and record of data for the data store in that Attack Path. Prisma Cloud decorates the data store that contains sensitive data with a crown jewel icon. Note that the icon is displayed for individual assets and not for grouped nodes.

Prisma Cloud supports the following list of assets that are currently in the attack path and in the DSPM module:

* AWS: S3, EC2 Instance, RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift

* Azure: Azure Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Azure Virtual Machine

* GCP: Cloud SQL, Spanner, Cloud Storage, Bigtable

image::dspm-attack-path-1.png[]

Additionally, when you select an asset on the Asset Inventory page a new *Data* tab in the asset sidecar displays data findings such as data types and labels.

|*Improved Shared Views*
//RLP-147440

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.9.1]

|Enhancements to Saved Views in Prisma Cloud allow you to share custom views with ease. If you are the creator of a custom view, you can now set the default visibility of view when you share it. Navigate to *Home > Alerts > Manage Views* and use the checkbox option to *Make this dashboard visible for all viewers*. Previously, publicly shared views were hidden by default even when shared, and visibility had to toggled on individually. Views can also be toggled off if desired. Learn more about https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/alerts/saved-views[Saved Views].

|*Jira Integration Support for Versions 9.0 and Above*

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.9.1]

//RLP-141021

|Prisma Cloud has enhanced its Prisma Cloud Technical Documentation https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/administration/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/integrate-prisma-cloud-with-jira[Jira integration] to work with all Jira Cloud and Jira On-Premise versions including 9.0 and above. This enhancement will enable you to receive Prisma Cloud alert notifications in your Jira accounts.  

| *Transition from OVAL to VEX Format for Red Hat Security Data*

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.00.169]

// CWP-61485/CWP-59337

| Prisma Cloud is transitioning from the OVAL format to the new VEX format that Red Hat has introduced and adopted for reporting security data and vulnerabilities in Red Hat artifacts.

*Pre-33.00*: Until you upgrade to a 33.xx release, Prisma Cloud will continue using OVAL for vulnerability scanning with no expected impact.

*33.xx*: After upgrading your Console and Defenders to version 33.00 or later, Prisma Cloud will switch to the VEX format for vulnerability reporting. This transition might result in a change in the number of reported CVEs due to the inherent differences between the VEX and OVAL content.

*Comparison Between OVAL and VEX Formats*: With the OVAL format, Prisma Cloud reports vulnerabilities for each binary found during the scan. However, with the new VEX format, Prisma Cloud will report one vulnerability for the source package and provide information on related binaries.

This means that the number of vulnerabilities with the same CVE ID will be reduced, as Prisma Cloud will report one vulnerability for the RPM package instead of multiple reports for each binary.

*Continued Support*: Prisma Cloud will continue to support OVAL format for two major versions—v33.xx and v34.xx—to maintain compatibility with Defenders in pre-33.xx releases, as long as Red Hat continues to produce OVAL files.

*Expected Console Loading Time in the 33.xx release*: For new Consoles paired with new Defenders, the Console loading time after a restart event will be approximately 1-2 minutes.

*Console Memory Usage in the 33.XX release*: For on-premise users upgrading to the latest Console, the Console memory requirement is 8 GB. This requirement is only for the self-hosted editions.

For a more detailed explanation of this transition, see the https://main%2D%2Dprisma-cloud-docs-website%2D%2Dhlxsites.hlx.live/en/compute-edition/assets/pdf/lookahead-transition-to-vex-format.pdf[Transition from Oval to VEX Files] document.

If you have any concerns or need additional information about this transition, contact support@paloaltonetworks.com.

| *Enhancement to WAAS Agentless Support*

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.00.169]

// CWP-59339

| WAAS agentless rules now support traffic inspection for AWS Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in addition to AWS EC2 instances. Ensure your AWS account is onboarded to the Prisma Cloud console and then configure the ALB rule.

To add the ALB rule access *Defend > WAAS > Add Rule > Add Configuration*. Ensure your CloudFormation template is applied with the necessary permissions to your onboarded AWS account in the region where the ALB resides. You can view the scan results in the Prisma Cloud console to monitor and manage your ALB traffic inspection.

NOTE: This feature is enabled on request. Please contact your Account team for more details.

|*Audit Logs Retention Period*
//RLP-146965, RLP-147876

tt:[24.9.2]

|The Audit logs from AWS, Azure, GCP Cloud providers, and Prisma Cloud are purged from the live system after 120 days or when the total number of logs exceeds 1.2 billion, whichever comes first. Once the logs are purged, they are no longer accessible via RQL queries on the *Investigate* page in Prisma Cloud. However, the data on the logs are retained in an archived, encrypted format for the duration of your contract.

*Impact—* Once the logs are purged, they will not be accessible via RQL queries on the *Investigate* page in Prisma Cloud. However, the data on the logs will be retained in an archived, encrypted format for the duration of your contract. 

To retrieve any purged data, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.


|*Audit Logs Warning*
//RLP-148505

tt:[24.9.1]

|If you have configured your AWS account or organization to ingest audit logs through EventBridge, you might see a warning message stating: 
`Rule <prisma-cloud-your-tenant-id-audit-logs-rule> does not exist on EventBus default in <region>`

This warning is due to performance enhancements in the EventBridge rule configuration, which do not affect system functionality.
To resolve the warning, download the CloudFormation Template (CFT) from *Misconfigurations > Near Real-Time Visibility > Edit*, and update your CFT stack in AWS. For detailed instructions, see https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/connect/connect-cloud-accounts/onboard-aws/configure-audit-logs#:~:text=Time%20Visibility.-,Configure%20Details.,-Click%20Download%20EventBridge[Configure Audit Logs].

*Impact—* Updating the CFT will result in an increase in the number of EventBridge rules enabling Prisma Cloud to ingest only the relevant audit logs.

|*AWS S3 bucket used for storing AWS Bedrock Custom model training artifacts*

tt:[24.9.2]
//RLP-149533

|This policy identifies the AWS S3 bucket used for storing AWS Bedrock Custom model training job output.

S3 buckets hold the results and artifacts generated from training models in AWS Bedrock. Ensuring proper configuration and access control is crucial to maintaining the security and integrity of the training output. Improperly secured S3 buckets used for storing AWS Bedrock training output can lead to unauthorized access and potential exposure of model information.

It is recommended to implement strict access controls, enable encryption, and audit permissions to secure AWS S3 buckets for AWS Bedrock training job output and ensure compliance.

NOTE: This policy is designed to identify the S3 buckets utilized for storing results and storing artifacts generated from training custom models in AWS Bedrock. It does not signify any detected misconfiguration or security risk.

|*AWS Bedrock Custom model encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK) is not enabled for regular rotation*

tt:[24.9.2]
//RLP-149520

|This policy identifies AWS Bedrock Custom model encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK) is not enabled for regular rotation.

AWS KMS (Key Management Service) allows customers to create master keys to encrypt the Custom model. Not enabling regular rotation for AWS Bedrock custom model key rotation failure can result in potential compliance violations.

As a security best practice, it is important to rotate the keys periodically so that if the keys are compromised, the data in the underlying service is still secure with the new keys.

|*Azure DNS Zone having dangling DNS Record vulnerable to subdomain takeover associated with Azure Storage account blob*

tt:[24.9.2]
//RLP-149355

|This policy identifies DNS records within an Azure DNS zone that point to Azure Storage Account blobs that no longer exist.

A dangling DNS attack happens when a DNS record points to a cloud resource that has been deleted or is inactive, making the subdomain vulnerable to takeover. An attacker can exploit this by creating a new resource with the same name and taking control of the subdomain to serve malicious content. This allows attackers to host harmful content under your subdomain, which could lead to phishing attacks, data breaches, and damage to your reputation. The risk arises because the DNS record still references a non-existent resource, which unauthorized individuals can re-associate with their own resources.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to routinely audit DNS zones and remove or update DNS records pointing to non-existing Azure Storage Account blobs.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-dns-recordsets' AND json.rule = type contains CNAME and properties.CNAMERecord.cname contains "web.core.windows.net" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and properties.primaryEndpoints.web exists as Y; filter 'not ($.Y.properties.primaryEndpoints.web contains $.X.properties.CNAMERecord.cname) '; show X;
----

|*Azure DNS Zone having dangling DNS Record vulnerable to subdomain takeover associated with Web App Service*

tt:[24.9.2]
//RLP-149354

|This policy identifies DNS records within an Azure DNS zone that point to Azure Web App Services that no longer exist.

A dangling DNS attack happens when a DNS record points to a cloud resource that has been deleted or is inactive, making the subdomain vulnerable to takeover. An attacker can exploit this by creating a new resource with the same name and taking control of the subdomain to serve malicious content. This allows attackers to host harmful content under your subdomain, which could lead to phishing attacks, data breaches, and damage to your reputation.

|*GCP Storage bucket CMEK not rotated every 90 days*

tt:[24.9.2]
//RLP-148007

|This policy identifies GCP Storage bucket with CMEK that are not rotated every 90 days

A CMEK (Customer-Managed Encryption Key), which is configured for a GCP bucket becomes vulnerable over time due to prolonged use. Without regular rotation, the key is at greater risk of being compromised, which could lead to unauthorized access to the encrypted data in the bucket. This can undermine the security of your data and increase the chances of a breach if the key is exposed or exploited.

It is recommended to configure rotation less than 90 days for CMEKs used for GCP buckets.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-kms-crypto-keys-list' AND json.rule = primary.state equals "ENABLED" and (rotationPeriod does not exist or rotationPeriod greater than 7776000) as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-storage-buckets-list' as Y; filter ' $.X.name equals $.Y.encryption.defaultKmsKeyName'; show Y;
----

|*GCP Storage bucket using a disabled CMEK*

tt:[24.9.2]
//RLP-148002

|This policy identifies GCP Storage buckets that are using a disabled CMEK.

CMEK (Customer-Managed Encryption Keys) for GCP buckets allows you to use your own encryption keys to secure data stored in Google Cloud Storage. If a CMEK defined for a GCP bucket is disabled, the data in that bucket becomes inaccessible, as the encryption keys are no longer available to decrypt the data. This can lead to data loss and operational disruption. If not properly managed, CMEK can also introduce risks such as accidental key deletion or mismanagement, which could compromise data availability and security.

It is recommended to review the state of CMEK and enable it to keep the data in the bucket accessible.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-kms-crypto-keys-list' AND json.rule = primary.state does not equal "ENABLED" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-storage-buckets-list' as Y; filter ' $.X.name equals $.Y.encryption.defaultKmsKeyName'; show Y;
----

|*GCP VM instance is assigned with public IP*

tt:[24.9.2]
//RLP-147863

|This policy identifies GCP VM instances that are assigned a public IP.

Using a public IP with a GCP VM exposes it directly to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and attacks. This makes the VM vulnerable to threats such as brute force attempts, DDoS attacks, and other malicious activities. To mitigate these risks, it's safer to use private IPs and secure access methods like VPNs or load balancers.

It is recommended to avoid assigning public IPs to VM instances.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-instances-list' AND json.rule = name does not start with "gke-" and (networkInterfaces[*].accessConfigs exists or networkInterfaces.ipv6AccessConfigs exists)
----

|*GCP VM instance with Shielded VM Secure Boot disabled*

tt:[24.9.2]
//RLP-147863

|This policy identifies GCP VM instances that have Shielded VM Secure Boot disabled.

Secure Boot is a security feature that ensures only trusted, digitally signed software runs during the boot process of a computer. Enabling it helps protect against malware and unauthorized software by verifying the integrity of the bootloader and operating system. Without Secure Boot, systems are vulnerable to rootkits, bootkits, and other malicious code that can compromise the system from the start, making it difficult to detect and remove such threats.

It is recommended to enable Shielded VM secure boot for GCP VM instances.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-instances-list' AND json.rule = status equals RUNNING and name does not start with "gke-" and (shieldedInstanceConfig does not exist or shieldedInstanceConfig.enableSecureBoot is false )
----

|*GCP OS Image is publicly accessible*

tt:[24.9.2]
//RLP-147856

|This policy identifies GCP OS Images that are publicly accessible.

Custom GCP OS images are user-created operating system images tailored to specific needs and configurations. Making these images public can expose sensitive data, proprietary software, and security vulnerabilities. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system exploitation, compromising your infrastructure's security and integrity.

It is recommended to keep OS images private unless required for organizational needs.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-image' AND json.rule = iamPolicy.bindings[?any( members contains "allAuthenticatedUsers" )] exists
----

|*OCI Compute Instance with Secure Boot disabled*

tt:[24.9.2]
//RLP-149358

|This policy identifies OCI compute instances in which Secure Boot is disabled.

Secure Boot serves as a security standard ensuring that a machine exclusively boots using Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) trusted software. Without the activation of Secure Boot, a compute instance becomes susceptible to booting unauthorized or malicious software, posing a threat to the integrity and security of the instance. Consequently, this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activities within the instance.

As a security best practice, enabling Secure Boot on all compute instances is strongly recommended to guarantee the exclusive execution of trusted software during the boot process.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'oci' AND api.name = 'oci-compute-instance' AND json.rule = lifecycleState equal ignore case running AND (platformConfig does not exist OR platformConfig equal ignore case "null" OR platformConfig.isSecureBootEnabled is false)
----

|*AWS IAM user is not a member of any IAM group*

tt:[24.9.1]
//RLP-148660

|This policy identifies an AWS IAM user as not being a member of any IAM group.

It is generally a best practice to assign IAM users to at least one IAM group. If the IAM users are not in a group, it complicates permission management and auditing, increasing the risk of privilege mismanagement and security oversights. It also leads to higher operational overhead and potential non-compliance with security best practices.

It is recommended to ensure all IAM users are part of at least one IAM group according to your business requirement to simplify permission management, enforce consistent security policies, and reduce the risk of privilege mismanagement.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-iam-list-users' AND json.rule = groupList is empty
----

|*AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) is disabled*

tt:[24.9.1]
//RLP-148659

|This policy identifies the AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) that is disabled.

Ensuring that your Amazon Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key is enabled is important because it determines whether the key can be used to perform cryptographic operations.  If an AWS KMS Key is disabled, any operations dependent on that key, such as encryption or decryption of data, will fail. This can lead to application downtime, data access issues, and potential data loss if not addressed promptly.

It is recommended to enable the AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) if it is used in the application, to restore cryptographic operations and ensure your applications and services can access encrypted data.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' AND json.rule = keyMetadata.enabled is false

|*Azure Cognitive Services account hosted with OpenAI is not configured with data loss prevention*

tt:[24.9.1]
//RLP-124566

|This policy identifies Azure Cognitive Services accounts hosted with OpenAI that are not configured with data loss prevention. 

Azure AI services offer data loss prevention capabilities that allow customers to configure the list of outbound URLs their Azure AI services resources can access.

As a best practice, it is recommended to enable the data loss prevention feature in OpenAI-hosted Azure Cognitive Services accounts to prevent data loss.

*Policy Severity—* High
