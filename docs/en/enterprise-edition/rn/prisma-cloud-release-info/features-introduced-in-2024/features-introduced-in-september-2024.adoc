|*Improved Shared Views*
//RLP-147440

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.9.1]

|Enhancements to Saved Views in Prisma Cloud allow you to share custom views with ease. If you are the creator of a custom view, you can now set the default visibility of view when you share it. Navigate to *Home > Alerts > Manage Views* and use the checkbox option to *Make this dashboard visible for all viewers*. Previously, publicly shared views were hidden by default even when shared, and visibility had to toggled on individually. Views can also be toggled off if desired. Learn more about https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/alerts/saved-views[Saved Views].

|*Audit Logs Warning*
//RLP-148505

tt:[24.9.1]

|If you have configured your AWS account or organization to ingest audit logs through EventBridge, you might see a warning message stating: 
`Rule <prisma-cloud-your-tenant-id-audit-logs-rule> does not exist on EventBus default in <region>`

This warning is due to performance enhancements in the EventBridge rule configuration, which do not affect system functionality.
To resolve the warning, download the CloudFormation Template (CFT) from *Misconfigurations > Near Real-Time Visibility > Edit*, and update your CFT stack in AWS. For detailed instructions, see https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/connect/connect-cloud-accounts/onboard-aws/configure-audit-logs#:~:text=Time%20Visibility.-,Configure%20Details.,-Click%20Download%20EventBridge[Configure Audit Logs].

*Impact—* Updating the CFT will result in an increase in the number of EventBridge rules enabling Prisma Cloud to ingest only the relevant audit logs.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Policies*
|*Description*



|*AWS IAM user is not a member of any IAM group*

tt:[24.9.1]
//RLP-148660

|This policy identifies an AWS IAM user as not being a member of any IAM group.

It is generally a best practice to assign IAM users to at least one IAM group. If the IAM users are not in a group, it complicates permission management and auditing, increasing the risk of privilege mismanagement and security oversights. It also leads to higher operational overhead and potential non-compliance with security best practices.

It is recommended to ensure all IAM users are part of at least one IAM group according to your business requirement to simplify permission management, enforce consistent security policies, and reduce the risk of privilege mismanagement.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-iam-list-users' AND json.rule = groupList is empty
----

|*AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) is disabled*

tt:[24.9.1]
//RLP-148659

|This policy identifies the AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) that is disabled.

Ensuring that your Amazon Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key is enabled is important because it determines whether the key can be used to perform cryptographic operations.  If an AWS KMS Key is disabled, any operations dependent on that key, such as encryption or decryption of data, will fail. This can lead to application downtime, data access issues, and potential data loss if not addressed promptly.

It is recommended to enable the AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) if it is used in the application, to restore cryptographic operations and ensure your applications and services can access encrypted data.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' AND json.rule = keyMetadata.enabled is false

|*Azure Application Gateway listener not secured with SSL profile*

tt:[24.9.1]
//RLP-147324

|This policy identifies Azure Application Gateway listeners that are not secured with an SSL profile.

An SSL profile provides a secure channel by encrypting the data transferred between the client and the application gateway. Without SSL profiles, the data transferred is vulnerable to interception, posing security risks. This could lead to potential data breaches and compromise sensitive information.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to secure all Application Gateway listeners with SSL profiles. This ensures data confidentiality and integrity by encrypting traffic.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-application-gateway' AND json.rule = ['properties.provisioningState'] equal ignore case Succeeded AND ['properties.httpListeners'][].['properties.provisioningState'] equal ignore case Succeeded AND ['properties.httpListeners'][].['properties.protocol'] equal ignore case Https AND ['properties.httpListeners'][*].['properties.sslProfile'].['id'] does not exist

|This policy identifies Azure Virtual Desktop workspaces where diagnostic logs are not enabled.

Diagnostic logs are vital for monitoring and troubleshooting Azure Virtual Desktop, which offers virtual desktops and remote app services. They help detect and resolve issues, optimize performance, and meet security and compliance standards. Without these logs, it’s difficult to track activities and detect anomalies, potentially jeopardizing security and efficiency.

As a best practice, it is recommended to enable diagnostic logs for Azure Virtual Desktop workspaces.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-virtual-desktop-workspace' AND json.rule = diagnostic-settings[?none( properties.logs[?any( enabled is true )] exists )] exists 
----

|*Azure Virtual Desktop disk encryption not configured with Customer Managed Key (CMK)*

tt:[24.9.1]
//RLP-148369

|This policy identifies Azure Virtual Desktop environments where disk encryption is not configured using a Customer Managed Key (CMK). 

Disk encryption is crucial for protecting data in Azure Virtual Desktop environments. By default, disks may be encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys, which might not meet specific security requirements. Using Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) offers better control over encryption, allowing organizations to manage key rotation, access, and revocation, thereby enhancing data security and compliance.

As a best practice, it is recommended to configure disk encryption for Azure Virtual Desktop with a Customer Managed Key (CMK). 

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-vm-list' AND json.rule = ['Extensions'].['Microsoft.PowerShell.DSC'].['settings'].['properties'].['hostPoolName'] exists and powerState contains running as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-disk-list' AND json.rule = provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and (encryption.type does not contain "EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey" or encryption.diskEncryptionSetId does not exist) as Y; filter ' $.X.id equal ignore case $.Y.managedBy '; show Y;
----

|*Azure Virtual Machine not protected with Azure Backup*

tt:[24.9.1]
//RLP-148370

|*Azure App Service Web app doesn't use latest TLS version*
//RLP-148541

tt:[24.9.1]

|*Changes—* The updated Policy RQL will not alert for minTlsVersion of 1.3.

*Current Description—* This policy identifies Azure web apps which are not set with latest version of TLS encryption. App service currently allows the web app to set TLS versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. It is highly recommended to use the latest TLS 1.2 version for web app secure connections.

*Updated Description—* This policy identifies Azure web apps that are not configured with the latest version of TLS encryption. Azure Web Apps provide a platform to host and manage web applications securely. 

Using the latest TLS version is crucial for maintaining secure connections. Older versions of TLS, such as 1.0 and 1.1, have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. Upgrading to newer versions like TLS 1.2 or 1.3 ensures that the web app is better protected against modern security threats.

It is highly recommended to use the latest TLS version (greater than 1.1) for secure web app connections.

*Current RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = kind starts with "app" AND config.minTlsVersion does not equal "1.2"
----

*Updated RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = kind starts with app and config.minTlsVersion is member of ('1.0', '1.1')
----
