|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Blobstore Scanning Defender Upgrade for Tanzu Customers*
//CWP-56798

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

|Enhanced the existing `blobstore` scanning feature for Tanzu customers. As a part of this enhancement, existing `blobstore` scanning defenders will now appear disconnected and new defender instances will be automatically created to replace them. The disconnected `blobstore` will disappear after 24 hours as part of the retention process. This upgrade excludes Linux and Windows defenders (Full coverage defenders).
If you have have configured `blobstore` scanning and assigned it to a specific `blobstore` defender after the release of 32.04, you are required to manually edit the configurations and change it to a newly created `blobstore` defender scanner. This release also supports a new tile - jammy for TAS.

|*Added Account ID Information to Defenders Dashboard*
//CWP-56557

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

|The *Account ID* information is displayed on the Defenders dashboard under *Manage > Defenders*. It is also included in the downloadable .csv file.

|*Enhanced Vulnerability Assessment Process*
//CWP-56782

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

|Prisma Cloud now has an enhanced vulnerability assessment process for applications installed through the OS. If Prisma Cloud cannot detect any vulnerabilities in the vendor feed, it automatically searches for third-party security data to ensure comprehensive security coverage. For a comprehensive list of the detected vulnerabilities, navigate to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer*.

//CWP-56790
//March 26: Blurb moved to update 5. Update in the Jira ticket.

|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*AWS RDS database instance not configured with encryption in transit*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-133165

|Identifies AWS RDS database instances that are not configured with encryption in transit. This covers MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and DB2 RDS instances. Enabling encryption is crucial to protect data as it moves through the network and enhances the security between clients and storage servers. Without encryption, sensitive data transmitted between your application and the database is vulnerable to interception by malicious actors. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential compromises of confidential information. It is recommended that data be encrypted while in transit to ensure its security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-parameter-groups' AND json.rule = (((dbparameterGroupFamily starts with "postgres" or dbparameterGroupFamily contains "sqlserver") and (['parameters'].['rds.force_ssl'].['parameterValue'] does not equal 1 or ['parameters'].['rds.force_ssl'].['parameterValue'] does not exist)) or ((dbparameterGroupFamily starts with "mariadb" or dbparameterGroupFamily starts with "mysql") and (parameters.require_secure_transport.parameterValue does not equal 1 or parameters.require_secure_transport.parameterValue does not exist)) or (dbparameterGroupFamily contains "db2-ae" and (parameters.db2comm.parameterValue does not equal ignore case "SSL" or parameters.db2comm.parameterValue does not exist))) as Y; filter '$.X.dbparameterGroups[*].dbparameterGroupArn equals $.Y.dbparameterGroupArn' ; show X;
----

|*AWS Cognito service role does not have identity pool verification*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-132945

|Identifies the AWS Cognito service role that does not have identity pool verification. AWS Cognito is an identity and access management service for web and mobile apps. AWS Cognito service roles define permissions for AWS services accessing resources. The 'aud' claim in a cognito service role is an identity pool token that specifies the intended audience for the token. If the aud claim is not enforced in the cognito service role trust policy, it could potentially allow tokens issued for one audience to be used to access resources intended for a different audience. This oversight increases the risk of unauthorized access, compromising access controls and elevating the potential for data breaches within the AWS environment. It is recommended to implement proper validation of the 'aud' claim by adding the 'aud' in the Cognito service role trust policy.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-iam-list-roles' AND json.rule = role.assumeRolePolicyDocument.Statement[*].Action contains "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity" and role.assumeRolePolicyDocument.Statement[*].Principal.Federated contains "cognito-identity.amazonaws.com" and role.assumeRolePolicyDocument.Statement[*].Effect contains "Allow" and role.assumeRolePolicyDocument.Statement[*].Condition.StringEquals does not contain "cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:aud"
----

|*AWS Cognito service role with wide privileges does not validate authentication*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-132112

|Identifies the AWS Cognito service role that has wide privileges and does not validate user authentication. AWS Cognito is an identity and access management service for web and mobile apps. AWS Cognito service roles define permissions for AWS services accessing resources. The 'amr' field in the service role represents how the user was authenticated. if the user was authenticated using any of the supported providers, the 'amr' will contain 'authenticated' and the name of the provider. Not validating the 'amr' field can allow an unauthenticated user (guest access) with a valid token signed by the identity-pool to assume the Cognito role. If this Cognito role has a '*' wildcard in the action and resource, it could lead to lateral movement or unauthorized access. 
Ensuring limiting privileges according to business requirements can help in restricting unauthorized access and misuse of resources. It is recommended to limit the Cognito service role used for guest access to not have a '*' wildcard in the action or resource.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-iam-list-roles' AND json.rule = role.assumeRolePolicyDocument.Statement[*].Action contains "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity" and role.assumeRolePolicyDocument.Statement[*].Principal.Federated contains "cognito-identity.amazonaws.com" and role.assumeRolePolicyDocument.Statement[*].Effect contains "Allow" and role.assumeRolePolicyDocument.Statement[*].Condition contains "cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:amr" and role.assumeRolePolicyDocument.Statement[*].Condition contains "unauthenticated" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = document.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and Action contains :* and Resource equals * )] exists as Y; filter "($.X.inlinePolicies[*].policyDocument.Statement[?(@.Effect=='Allow' && @.Resource=='*')].Action contains :* ) or ($.X.attachedPolicies[*].policyArn intersects $.Y.policyArn)"; show X;
----

|*AWS Redshift cluster with a commonly used master username and public access setting enabled*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-132006

|Identifies AWS Redshift clusters configured with commonly used master usernames like 'awsuser', 'administrator', or 'admin', and the public access setting is enabled. AWS Redshift, a managed data warehousing service typically stores sensitive and critical data. Allowing public access increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential malicious activities. Using standard usernames increases the risk of password brute-force attacks by potential intruders. As a recommended security measure, it is advised not to use commonly used usernames and to disable public access for the Redshift cluster.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-redshift-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = publiclyAccessible is true and masterUsername is member of ("awsuser","administrator","admin")
----

|*AWS Redshift cluster is configured with public accessibility*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-131415

|Identifies AWS Redshift clusters with the publicly accessible setting set to true. When Amazon Redshift clusters are made public, the likelihood of malicious activity increases, such as unauthorized access or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. As a security best practice, the public accessibility parameter of the Redshift cluster should be turned off.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-redshift-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = publiclyAccessible is true

|*AWS CloudTrail S3 bucket encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK) that is scheduled for deletion*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-131340

|Identifies AWS CloudTrail S3 buckets encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK) that is scheduled for deletion. CloudTrail logs contain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. These log files stored in Amazon S3 are encrypted by AWS KMS keys. Deleting keys in AWS KMS that are used by CloudTrail is a common defense evasion technique and could be a potential ransomware attacker activity. After a key is deleted, you can no longer decrypt the data that was encrypted under that key, which helps the attacker to hide their malicious activities. It is recommended to regularly monitor the key used for encryption to prevent accidental deletion.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = (sseAlgorithm contains "aws:kms" or sseAlgorithm contains "aws:kms:dsse") and kmsMasterKeyID exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' AND json.rule = keyMetadata.keyManager equal ignore case CUSTOMER and keyMetadata.keyState contains PendingDeletion as Y; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-cloudtrail-describe-trails' as Z; filter '$.X.kmsMasterKeyID contains $.Y.key.keyArn and $.Z.s3BucketName equals $.X.bucketName'; show X;
----

|*AWS SNS Topic not encrypted by Customer Managed Key (CMK)*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-133587

|Identifies AWS SNS Topics that are not encrypted by Customer Managed Key (CMK). AWS SNS Topics are used to send notifications to subscribers and might contain sensitive information. SNS Topics are encrypted by default by a AWS managed key but users can specify CMK to get enhanced security, control over the encryption key and also comply with any regulatory requirements. As a security best practice use of CMK to encrypt your SNS Topics is advisable as it gives you full control over the encrypted data.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-sns-get-topic-attributes' AND json.rule = KmsMasterKeyId exists and KmsMasterKeyId equal ignore case "alias/aws/sns"
----

|*AWS Default VPC is being used*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-131815

|Identifies AWS Default VPCs that are being used. AWS creates a default VPC automatically upon the creation of your AWS account with a default security group and network access control list (NACL). Using AWS default VPC can lead to limited customization and security concerns due to shared resources and potential misconfigurations, hindering scalability and optimal resource management. As a best practice, using a custom VPC with specific security and network configuration provides greater flexibility and control over your architecture.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-vpcs' AND json.rule = default is true and shared is false and state equal ignore case available as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-network-interfaces' AND json.rule = status equal ignore case in-use as Y; filter '$.X.vpcId equals $.Y.vpcId'; show X;
----

|*AWS EKS cluster does not have secrets encryption enabled*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-131577

|Identifies AWS EKS clusters that do not have secrets encryption enabled. AWS EKS cluster secrets are, by default, stored unencrypted in the API server's underlying data store (etcd). Anyone with direct access to etcd or with API access can retrieve or modify the secrets. Using secrets encryption for your Amazon EKS cluster allows you to protect sensitive information such as passwords and API keys using Kubernetes-native APIs. It is recommended to enable secret encryption to ensure its security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-eks-describe-cluster' AND json.rule = encryptionConfig does not exist or (encryptionConfig exists and encryptionConfig[*].provider.keyArn does not exist and encryptionConfig[*].resources[*] does not contain secrets)
----

|*AWS Elastic Load Balancer v2 (ELBv2) with cross-zone load balancing disabled*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-132758

|Identifies load balancers that do not have cross-zone load balancing enabled. Cross-zone load balancing is a feature that evenly distributes incoming traffic across healthy targets in all availability zones that have been configured. This can help to ensure that your application is able to manage additional traffic and limit the danger of any single availability zone getting overwhelmed and perhaps affecting load balancer performance. So, it is recommended to enable cross-zone load balancing.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-elbv2-describe-load-balancers' AND json.rule = ['attributes'].['load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled'] is false
----

|*AWS MSK cluster encryption in transit is not enabled*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-132746

|Identifies AWS MSK clusters with encryption in transit in a disabled state. Without in-transit encryption, data can be intercepted when moving between brokers. So it is recommended to enable in-transit encryption between brokers within a cluster to ensure that data exchanged between brokers within the cluster is encrypted, thereby protecting sensitive data from eavesdropping and unauthorized access.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-msk-cluster' AND json.rule = encryptionInfo.encryptionInTransit.clientBroker contains PLAINTEXT or encryptionInfo.encryptionInTransit.inCluster is false
----

|*AWS RDS Postgres Cluster does not have Query Logging enabled*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-131748

|Identifies RDS Postgres clusters with query logging disabled. In AWS RDS PostgreSQL, by default, the logging level captures login failures, fatal server errors, deadlocks, and query failures. To log data changes, we recommend enabling cluster logging for monitoring and troubleshooting. To obtain adequate logs, an RDS cluster should have log_statement and log_min_duration_statement parameters configured. It is a best practice to enable additional RDS cluster logging, which will help in data change monitoring and troubleshooting.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-rds-db-cluster-parameter-group' AND json.rule = parameters.log_min_duration_statement.ParameterValue does not exist or parameters.log_min_duration_statement.ParameterValue equals -1 as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-rds-db-cluster' AND json.rule = status contains available and engine contains postgres as Y; filter '$.X.DBClusterParameterGroupName equals $.Y.dbclusterParameterGroup'; show Y;

|*GCP Composer environment web server network access control allows access from all IP addresses*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-131810

|Identifies GCP Composer environments with web server network access control that allows access from all IP addresses. Web server network access controls which IP addresses will have access to the Airflow web server. By default, this feature allows all connections from the public internet. Allowing all traffic to the composer environment may allow a bad actor to brute force their way into the system and potentially get access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic solely from known static IP addresses. Limit the access list to include known hosts, services, or specific employees only.

|*GCP Cloud Run service is using default service account with editor role*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-131795

|Identifies GCP Cloud Run services that are utilizing the default service account with the editor role. In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the Compute Engine Default service account is automatically created upon enabling the Compute Engine API. This service account is granted the IAM basic Editor role by default, unless explicitly disabled. To adhere to the principle of least privilege and mitigate potential privilege escalation risks, it is recommended not to assign the default service account, particularly when granting the editor role. This ensures that instances are provisioned with minimal access rights, promoting a better security posture.

|*GCP GKE cluster node boot disk not encrypted with CMEK*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-131273

|Identifies GCP GKE clusters that do not have their node boot disk encrypted with CMEK. The GKE node boot disk is the persistent disk that houses the Kubernetes node file system. By default, this disk is encrypted by a GCP managed key but users can specify customer managed encryption key to get enhanced security, control over the encryption key, and also comply with any regulatory requirements. As a security best practice use of CMEK to encrypt the boot disk of GKE cluster nodes is advisable.

|*GCP SQL Instance with public IP address does not have authorized network configured*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-130674

|Identifies GCP Cloud SQL instances with public IP addresses that do not have authorized network configured. Clients can connect to the SQL instance securely by using the Cloud SQL Proxy or adding the client's public address as an authorized network. If the client application is connecting directly to a Cloud SQL instance on its public IP address, client's external IP address needs to be added as an Authorized network to allow the connection. It is recommended to add authorized networks to reduce the access vector.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

|Identifies Dataproc Clusters that are not configured with CMEK. Dataproc cluster and job data are stored on persistent disks associated with the Compute Engine VMs in the cluster as well as in a Cloud Storage staging bucket. As a security best practice use of CMEK to encrypt this data on persistent disk and bucket is advisable and provides more control to the user.

|*GCP PostgreSQL instance database flag cloudsql.enable_pgaudit is not set to on*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-129326

|Identifies PostgreSQL database instances in which database flag cloudsql.enable_pgaudit is not set to on. Enabling the flag cloudsql.enable_pgaudit enables the logging by pgAudit extension for the database (if installed). The pgAudit extension for PostgreSQL databases provides detailed session and object logging to comply with government, financial, & ISO standards and provides auditing capabilities to mitigate threats by monitoring security events on the instance. Any changes to the database logging configuration should be made in accordance with the organization's logging policy.

|*GCP PostgreSQL instance database flag log_min_error_statement is not set*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-129324

|Identifies PostgreSQL database instances in which database flag log_min_error_statement is not set. The log_min_error_statement flag defines the minimum message severity level that are considered as an error statement. Messages for error statements are logged with the SQL statement. Valid values include DEBUG5, DEBUG4, DEBUG3, DEBUG2, DEBUG1, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR, LOG, FATAL, and PANIC. Each severity level includes the subsequent levels. log_min_error_statement flag value changes should only be made in accordance with the organization's logging policy. Proper auditing can help in troubleshooting operational problems and also permits forensic analysis.

|*GCP Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebook is using a default service account with the editor role*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-133952

|Identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks that are using the default service account with the editor role. When you create a new Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebook, the compute engine default service account is associated with the notebook by default if any other service account is not configured. The compute engine default service account is automatically created when the Compute Engine API is enabled and is granted the IAM basic Editor role if you have not disabled this behavior explicitly. These permissions can be exploited to get admin access to the GCP project. To be compliant with the principle of least privileges and prevent potential privilege escalation, it is recommended that Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks are not assigned the 'Compute Engine default service account' especially when the editor role is granted to the service account.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

|tt:[Update] *Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud set to Off for DNS*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-130970

|*Changes—* The Policy description and RQL have been updated to check either of the config i.e, Azure Microsoft Defender for servers plan 2 (which includes DNS) has not been enabled or Azure Microsoft Classic Defender for Cloud which has defender setting for DNS set to Off. 

*Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current Policy Description—* Identifies Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud which has defender setting for DNS set to Off. Enabling Azure Defender provides advanced security capabilities like providing threat intelligence, anomaly detection, and behavior analytics in the Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Defender for DNS monitors the queries and detects suspicious activities without the need for any additional agents on your resources. It is highly recommended to enable Azure Defender for DNS.

*Updated Policy Description—* Identifies Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud which has a defender setting for DNS set to Off. Enabling Azure Defender for the cloud provides advanced security capabilities like threat intelligence, anomaly detection, and behavior analytics. Defender for DNS monitors the queries and detects suspicious activities without the need for any additional agents on your resources. It is highly recommended to enable Azure Defender for DNS.
