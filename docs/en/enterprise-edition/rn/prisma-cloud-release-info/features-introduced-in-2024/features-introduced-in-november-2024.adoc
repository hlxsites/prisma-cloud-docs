[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

//to verify if below changes are implemented in 11.1 else keep as is in LA

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Audit Logs Pagination and Filter*
//RLP-151119

|The Audit Logs include enhancements to improve performance, reduce data load times, and provide more granular control over data retrieval:

* The Audit Logs page displays paginated data, which enhances navigation through extensive logs and the filtering options provide you with more control over your log data. 

* Use the new POST /audit/api/v1/log endpoint to programatically leverage the new pagination and filter capabilities to streamline your use cases.
//add https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/get-audit-logs/[POST /audit/api/v1/log] once it's live 

|*Governance Dashboard and Policy Endpoint Updates*
//RLP-150508

|A new filter option for *Asset Type* is available on the *Governance* page, which allows you to filter the policy list based on the type of asset associated with the policy.

The https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/get-policies-v-2/[GET /v2/policy] endpoint has a new `resource.type` query parameter to enable filtering the policy list by asset type. The response also includes the `resource.type` to indicate the Asset Type associated with each returned policy.

The CSV download from the *Governance* page also includes a new *Asset Type* column.

|*Google Kubernetes Engine*
//RLP-150422

|The JSON resource attributes `isMasterVersionSupported` and `isNodeVersionSupported` for *gcloud-container-describe-clusters* API are updated to align with the CSP *GetServerConfig* API. This change provides accurate results for policy violation alerts related to the default policies— *GCP GKE unsupported Master node version* and *GCP GKE unsupported node version*.

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts. New alerts will be generated against policy violations based on the complete GKE version used for clusters and nodes. If you have custom policies, you must manually update them to receive the alerts.

|*AWS Identity Store User Count Updates*
//RLP-151885, RLP-151629

|Prisma Cloud no longer ingests AWS Identity Store users that are visible to, but not owned by, AWS accounts. Only users directly owned by an AWS account will be ingested.

*Impact*: Any existing alerts for AWS Identity Store users in accounts that do not own the respective Identity Stores will be automatically closed.

=== New Policies

[cols="40%a,60%a"]
|===
|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*Azure VM disk configured with public network access*
//RLP-152251

|This policy identifies Azure Virtual Machine disks that are configured with public network access.

Allowing public access to Azure Virtual Machine disk resources increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Public network access exposes sensitive data to external threats, which attackers could exploit to compromise VM disks. Disabling public access and using Azure Private Link reduces exposure, ensuring only trusted networks have access and enhancing the security of your Azure environment by minimizing the risk of data leaks and breaches.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to disable public network access for Azure Virtual Machine disks.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-disk-list' AND json.rule = publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled and networkAccessPolicy equal ignore case AllowAll and managedBy contains virtualMachines
----

|*Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud set to Off for Agentless container vulnerability assessment*
//RLP-152102

|This policy identifies Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud where the Agentless container vulnerability assessment is set to Off.

Agentless container vulnerability assessment enables automatic scanning for vulnerabilities in container images stored in Azure Container Registry or running in Azure Kubernetes Service without additional agents. Disabling it exposes container images to unpatched security issues and misconfigurations, risking exploitation and data breaches. Enabling agentless container vulnerability assessment ensures continuous scanning for known vulnerabilities, enhancing security by proactively identifying risks and providing remediation suggestions to maintain compliance with industry standards.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to enable Agentless container vulnerability assessment in Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-security-center-settings' AND json.rule = not (pricings[?any(properties.extensions[?any(name equal ignore case ContainerRegistriesVulnerabilityAssessments AND isEnabled is true)] exists AND properties.pricingTier equal ignore case Standard )] exists)
----

|*Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud set to Off for File Integrity Monitoring*
//RLP-152101

|This policy identifies Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud where the File Integrity Monitoring is set to Off.

File Integrity Monitoring tracks critical system files in Windows and Linux for unauthorized changes, helping to identify potential attacks. Disabling File Integrity Monitoring leaves your system vulnerable to unnoticed alterations, increasing the risk of data breaches or system failures. Enabling FIM enhances security by alerting you to suspicious changes, allowing for proactive threat detection and prevention of unauthorized modifications to system files.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to enable File Integrity Monitoring in Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-security-center-settings' AND json.rule = not (pricings[?any(properties.extensions[?any(name equal ignore case FileIntegrityMonitoring AND isEnabled is true)] exists AND properties.pricingTier equal ignore case Standard )] exists)
----

|*Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud set to Off for Agentless scanning for machines*
//RLP-152100

|This policy identifies Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud where the Agentless scanning for machines is set to Off.

Agentless scanning uses disk snapshots to detect installed software, vulnerabilities, and plain text secrets without needing agents on each machine. When disabled, your environment risks exposure to software vulnerabilities and unauthorized software, diminishing visibility into security issues. Enabling Agentless scanning improves security by identifying vulnerabilities and sensitive data with minimal performance impact, streamlining management and ensuring strong threat detection and compliance.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to enable Agentless scanning for machines in Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-security-center-settings' AND json.rule = not (pricings[?any(properties.extensions[?any(name equal ignore case AgentlessVmScanning AND isEnabled is true)] exists AND properties.pricingTier equal ignore case Standard )] exists)
----

|*Azure Machine Learning workspace Storage account Datastore using Account key based authentication*
//RLP-151014

|This policy identifies Azure Machine Learning workspace datastores that use storage account keys for authentication.

Account key-based authentication is a security risk because it grants full, unrestricted access to the storage account, including the ability to read, write, and delete all data. If compromised, attackers can control all data in the account. This method lacks permission granularity and time limits, increasing the risk of exposing sensitive information. Using SAS tokens provides more granular control, allowing you to limit access to specific resources and set time-bound access, which enhances security and reduces risks in production environments.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to use SAS tokens for authenticating Azure Machine Learning datastores.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-machine-learning-datastores' AND json.rule = (properties.datastoreType equal ignore case AzureFile or properties.datastoreType equal ignore case AzureBlob) and properties.credentials.credentialsType equal ignore case AccountKey
----

|*Azure Machine Learning workspace not configured with user-assigned managed identity*
//RLP-151011

|This policy identifies Azure Machine Learning workspaces that are not configured with a user-assigned managed identity. 

By default, Azure Machine Learning workspaces use system-assigned managed identities to access resources like Azure Container Registry, Key Vault, Storage, and Application Insights. However, user-assigned managed identities offer better control over the identity's lifecycle and consistent access management across multiple resources. Since system-assigned identities are tied to the workspace and deleted if the workspace is removed, using a user-assigned identity allows access management independently, enhancing security and compliance.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to configure the Azure Machine Learning workspace with a user-assigned managed identity.

|*OCI Load balancer not configured with Web application firewall (WAF)*
//RLP-62238

|This policy identifies OCI Load balancers that are not configured with a Web application firewall (WAF).

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. Without WAF, load balancers are vulnerable to various web-based attacks, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common exploits. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.

As a best practice, it is recommended to configure Web Application Firewall (WAF) for OCI Load Balancers to enhance security.

|*GCP SQL Instances do not have valid SSL configuration*
//RLP-150532

|*Current Policy Description*

This policy identifies GCP SQL instances that do not have valid SSL configuration with an unexpired SSL certificate. Cloud SQL supports connecting to an instance using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If Cloud SQL Auth proxy is not used for authentication, it is recommended to utilize SSL for connection to SQL Instance, ensuring the security for data in transit.

*Updated Policy Description*

This policy identifies GCP SQL instances that either lack SSL configuration or have SSL certificates that have expired.

If an SQL instance is not configured to use SSL, it may accept unencrypted and insecure connections, leading to potential risks such as data interception and authentication vulnerabilities.

It is a best practice to enable SSL configuration to ensure data security and integrity when communicating with a GCP SQL instance.

*Current Policy RQL*
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-sql-instances-list' and json.rule = "(settings.ipConfiguration.requireSsl is true and _DateTime.ageInDays(serverCaCert.expirationTime) > -1) or not (settings.ipConfiguration.requireSsl is true)"

----
 
*Policy Type—* Config

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Impact—* Low

*Alerts Impact—* Alerts will be triggered in case the SQL instance is configured with SSL mode as ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED or TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED with expired certificate.

Open Alerts will be resolved in case the SQL instance is configured with SSL mode as ENCRYPTED_ONLY or TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED with valid certificate.

[#iam-policy-updates]
=== IAM Policy Updates

The policy *Severity* levels for the following IAM policies will be adjusted to better align with the potential risks they pose.

*Impact—* If your alert rules use the *Policy Severity* filter, you may notice a slight change in the number of alerts. However, this change will not affect custom policies or policies where you have manually set the severity levels. For policies included in alert rules that are not based on severity, the number of alerts will remain unchanged.
