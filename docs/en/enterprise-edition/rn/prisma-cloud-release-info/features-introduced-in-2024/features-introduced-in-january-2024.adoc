[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Policies*
|*Description*


|*Azure Cognitive Services account not configured with private endpoint*

tt:[*24.1.2*]

//RLP-125893

|Identifies Azure Cognitive Services accounts that are not configured with private endpoint. Private endpoints in Azure AI service resources allow clients on a virtual network to securely access data over Azure Private Link. Configuring a private endpoint enables access to traffic coming from only known networks and prevents access from malicious or unknown IP addresses which includes IP addresses within Azure. It is recommended to create private endpoint for secure communication for your Cognitive Services account.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-cognitive-services-account' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] is empty
----

|*Azure Cognitive Services account is not configured with managed identity*

tt:[*24.1.2*]

//RLP-125799

|Identifies Azure Cognitive Services accounts that are not configured with managed identity. Managed identity can be used to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. Storing credentials in a code increases the threat surface in case of exploitation and also managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials. So as a security best practice, it is recommended to have the managed identity to your Cognitive Services account.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-cognitive-services-account' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and (identity.type does not exist or identity.type equal ignore case None)
----

|*Azure Cognitive Services account configured with public network access*

tt:[*24.1.2*]

//RLP-124668

|Identifies Azure Cognitive Services accounts configured with public network access. Overly permissive public network access allows access to resource through the internet using a public IP address. It is recommended to restrict IP ranges to allow access to your cognitive Services account and endpoint from specific public internet IP address ranges and is accessible only to restricted entities.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-cognitive-services-account' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled and (properties.networkAcls.defaultAction does not exist or properties.networkAcls.defaultAction equal ignore case Allow)
----

|*Attack Path Policies*
|New Attack Path policies are available. Log in to the Prisma Cloud console and filter for the list of available policies.

|*AWS S3 bucket encrypted using Customer Managed Key (CMK) with overly permissive policy*

tt:[*24.1.1*]

//RLP-124241

|Identifies Amazon S3 buckets that use Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) for encryption that have a key policy overly permissive. Amazon S3 bucket encryption key overly permissive can result in the exposure of sensitive data and potential compliance violations. As a security best practice, It is recommended to follow the principle of least privilege ensuring that the KMS key policy does not have all the permissions to be able to complete a malicious action.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = (sseAlgorithm contains "aws:kms" or sseAlgorithm contains "aws:kms:dsse") and kmsMasterKeyID exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' AND json.rule = keyMetadata.keyState equals Enabled and keyMetadata.keyManager equals CUSTOMER and policies.default.Statement[?any((Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *)and Condition does not exist)] exists as Y; filter '$.X.kmsMasterKeyID contains $.Y.key.keyArn' ; show X;
----


|*AWS S3 bucket encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK) is not enabled for regular rotation*

tt:[*24.1.1*]

//RLP-124147

|Identifies Amazon S3 buckets that use Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) for encryption but are not enabled with key rotation. Amazon S3 bucket encryption key rotation failure can result in prolonged exposure of sensitive data and potential compliance violations. As a security best practice, it is important to rotate these keys periodically. This ensures that if the keys are compromised, the data in the underlying service remains secure with the new keys.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = (sseAlgorithm contains "aws:kms" or sseAlgorithm contains "aws:kms:dsse") and kmsMasterKeyID exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' AND json.rule = keyMetadata.keyState equals Enabled and keyMetadata.keyManager equal ignore case CUSTOMER and keyMetadata.origin equals AWS_KMS and (rotation_status.keyRotationEnabled is false or rotation_status.keyRotationEnabled equals "null")as Y; filter '$.X.kmsMasterKeyID contains $.Y.key.keyArn'; show X;
----

|*AWS RDS database instance encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK) is not enabled for regular rotation*

tt:[*24.1.1*]

//RLP-121502

|Identifies Amazon RDS instances that use Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) for encryption but are not enabled with key rotation. Amazon RDS instance encryption key rotation failure can result in prolonged exposure of sensitive data and potential compliance violations. As a security best practice, it is important to periodically rotate these keys. This ensures that if the keys are compromised, the data in the underlying service remains secure with the new keys.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' and json.rule = storageEncrypted is true as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' AND json.rule = keyMetadata.keyState equals Enabled and keyMetadata.keyManager equals CUSTOMER and keyMetadata.origin equals AWS_KMS and (rotation_status.keyRotationEnabled is false or rotation_status.keyRotationEnabled equals "null") as Y; filter '($.X.kmsKeyId equals $.Y.key.keyArn)'; show X;
----

|*Azure Storage account encrypted by an encryption key configured access policy with privileged operations*

tt:[*24.1.1*]

//RLP-124037

|Identifies Azure Storage accounts which are encrypted by an encryption key configured access policy with privileged operations. Encryption keys should be kept confidential and only accessible to authorized entity with limited operation access. Allowing privileged access to an encryption key also allows to alter/delete the data that is encrypted by it, making the data more easily accessible. It is recommended to have restricted access policies to an encryption key so that only authorized entities can access it with limited operation access. 

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = properties.encryption.keySource equal ignore case "Microsoft.Keyvault" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-key-vault-list' and json.rule = properties.accessPolicies[*].permissions exists and (properties.accessPolicies[*].permissions.keys[*] intersects ('Decrypt', 'Encrypt', 'Release', 'Purge', 'all') or properties.accessPolicies[*].permissions.secrets[*] intersects ('Purge', 'all') or properties.accessPolicies[*].permissions.certificates[*] intersects ('Purge', 'all')) as Y; filter '$.Y.properties.vaultUri contains $.X.properties.encryption.keyvaultproperties.keyvaulturi'; show X;
----

|*Azure Storage account encrypted by an encryption key that is not rotated regularly*

tt:[*24.1.1*]

//RLP-124036

|Identifies Azure Storage accounts which are encrypted by an encryption key that is not rotated regularly. As a security best practice, it is important to rotate the keys periodically so that if the keys are compromised, the data in the underlying service is still secure with the new keys. 

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = properties.encryption.keySource equal ignore case "Microsoft.Keyvault" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-key-vault-list' and json.rule = keys[?any(attributes.exp equals -1 and attributes.enabled contains true)] exists as Y; filter '$.Y.properties.vaultUri contains $.X.properties.encryption.keyvaultproperties.keyvaulturi'; show X;
----

|*Azure AKS cluster configured with overly permissive API server access*

tt:[*24.1.1*]

//RLP-75135

|Identifies AKS clusters configured with overly permissive API server access. In Kubernetes, the API server receives requests to perform actions in the cluster such as to create resources or scale the number of nodes. To enhance cluster security and minimize attacks, the API server should only be accessible from a limited set of IP address ranges. These IP ranges allow defined IP address ranges to communicate with the API server. A request made to the API server from an IP address that is not part of these authorized IP ranges is blocked. It is recommended to configure AKS cluster with defined IP address ranges to communicate with the API server.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-kubernetes-cluster' AND json.rule = properties.powerState.code equal ignore case Running and properties.apiServerAccessProfile.enablePrivateCluster is false and (properties.apiServerAccessProfile.authorizedIPRanges does not exist or properties.apiServerAccessProfile.authorizedIPRanges is empty)
----

|*Azure Machine learning workspace configured with overly permissive network access*

tt:[*24.1.1*]

//RLP-58075

|Identifies Machine learning workspaces configured with overly permissive network access. Overly permissive public network access allows access to resource through the internet using a public IP address. It is recommended to restrict IP ranges to allow access to your workspace and endpoint from specific public internet IP address ranges and is accessible only to restricted entities.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-machine-learning-workspace' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled and (properties.ipAllowlist does not exist or properties.ipAllowlist is empty)
----
