tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-153672

|Secure your cloud assets with enhanced efficiency with https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/administration/action-plans[Prisma Cloud Action Plans]. Action Plans programmatically group multiple alerts related to a single affected asset into one actionable plan. Every Action Plans include a summary as well as specific remediation steps, tailored to effectively maximize risk reduction. 

* *Prioritization*—Action Plans group together alerts and assets that can be secured through a single fix, ensuring your security team spends time on the most effective outcomes. Actions are prioritized based on security context and Prisma Cloud alerts.
* *Execution and Delegation*—Leverage your integrations on Prisma Cloud to help delegate security fixes to your team through Jira tickets and/or Slack messages with a single click.
* *Detailed Visibility*—Ensure that every alert resolved or asset impacted is visible in one location, and provide detailed context to your security teams.
* *Security Fix Efficiency*—Using machine learning and generative models, Action Plans help summarize tasks acrossthe various alerts that impact the same asset, ensuring that there is a comprehensive plan to reduce alerts with the least number of required steps.

NOTE: Action Plans is released in a phased rollout and will be available on all Prisma Cloud stacks by December 23, 2024.


|*Search for Assets with Secrets*

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.12.1]

//RLP-151640 

|The *Secrets* attributes within the *Investigate > Asset* search help you prioritize and find assets with secret exposure risks. Along with *Finding* and *Vulnerability*, you can now also use *Secrets* as a security context to identify Attack Paths in your environment. You can create custom policies based on the specific asset query.

In order to use the *Secrets* attributes, make sure you have enabled *Agentless Scanning* during onboarding.

|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*Alibaba Cloud VPC flow log not enabled*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-153196

|This policy identifies Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) where flow logs are not enabled.

VPC flow logs capture information about the traffic entering and exiting network interfaces in the VPC. Without VPC flow logs, there is limited visibility into network traffic, making it challenging to detect and investigate suspicious activities, potential data breaches, or security policy violations. Enabling VPC flow logs enhances network monitoring, improves threat detection, and supports compliance requirements.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to enable VPC flow logs.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'alibaba_cloud' and api.name = 'alibaba-cloud-vpc' AND json.rule = vpcFlowLogs[*].flowLogId does not exist and status equal ignore case Available
----

|*Alibaba Cloud OSS bucket logging not enabled*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-153239

|This policy identifies Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) buckets that do not have logging enabled.

Enabling logging for OSS buckets helps capture access and operation events, which are critical for security monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing. Without logging, you lack visibility into who accesses and interacts with your bucket, potentially missing unauthorized access or suspicious behaviour.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to enable logging for OSS buckets.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'alibaba_cloud' and api.name = 'alibaba-cloud-oss-bucket-info' AND json.rule = bucket.logging.targetBucket does not exist
----

|*AWS ECR private repository with cross-account access*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-153409

|This policy identifies AWS ECR private repository that are configured with cross-account access. 

An ECR repository is a storage location within Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) where Docker container images are stored and managed. Granting cross-account access to an ECR repository risks unauthorized access and data exposure, requiring strict policy controls and monitoring.

It is recommended to implement strict access controls and allow only trusted entities to access to an ECR repository to mitigate security risks.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ecr-get-repository-policy' AND json.rule = policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal.AWS does not equal * and Principal does not equal * and Principal.AWS contains arn and Principal.AWS does not contain $.registryId))] exists
----

|*AWS CloudWatch Log groups not encrypted by Customer Managed Key (CMK)*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-153310

|This policy identifies AWS CloudWatch Log groups that are encrypted using the default KMS key instead of CMK (Customer Managed Key) or using a CMK that is disabled.

A CloudWatch Log Group is a collection of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. Encrypting with a Customer Managed Key (CMK) provides additional control over key rotation, management, and access policies compared to the default encryption.

As a security best practice, using CMK to encrypt your CloudWatch Log Groups is advisable as it gives you full control over the encrypted data.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—*

config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-cloudwatch-log-group' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' AND json.rule = keyMetadata.keyManager does not equal CUSTOMER or (keyMetadata.keyManager equals CUSTOMER and keyMetadata.keyState equals Disabled) as Y; filter '($.X.kmsKeyId does not exist ) or ($.X.kmsKeyId exists and $.X.kmsKeyId equals $.Y.keyMetadata.arn)'; show X;
----

|*AWS MSK cluster public access is enabled*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-153260

|This policy identifies the Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) Cluster is configured with public access enabled.

Amazon MSK gives you the option to turn on public access to the brokers of MSK clusters. When the AWS MSK Cluster is public there could be posibility that the data can be exposed publicly.

It is recommended to disable the public access on the AWS MSK cluster to prevent unathourized access and complaince requirements.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—*

|*AWS FSX Windows filesystem is not configured with file access auditing*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-153253

|This policy identifies the AWS FSX Windows filesystem not configured FileAccessAuditLogLevel and FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel.

Amazon FSx for Windows File Server supports auditing of end-user access to files, folders, and file shares. FileAccessAuditLogLevel and FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel Both settings can be configured to log successful events, failed events, both, or neither, depending on your auditing requirements. Not configuring these audit logs can lead to undetected unauthorized access and non-compliance with security regulations.

It is recommended to configure both log access to files and folders and access to file shares according to your business requirements to ensure comprehensive logging, providing visibility, accountability, and compliance, and enabling effective monitoring and incident response capabilities.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-fsx-file-system' AND json.rule = FileSystemType equals "WINDOWS" and ( WindowsConfiguration.AuditLogConfiguration.FileAccessAuditLogLevel equals "DISABLED" AND  WindowsConfiguration.AuditLogConfiguration.FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel equals "DISABLED") 
----

|*AWS EMR cluster is not enabled with termination protection*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-153170

|This policy identifies the AWS EMR Cluster that is not enabled with termination protection.

Termination protection protects your clusters from accidental termination, When termination protection is enabled, any attempt to terminate the cluster through the AWS Management Console, CLI, or API will be blocked unless the protection is explicitly disabled first. Termination protection useful for long-running or critical clusters where accidental termination could result in data loss or significant downtime.

It recommended to enable Termination protection on AWS EMR clusters from accidental termination.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-emr-describe-cluster' AND json.rule = status.state does not contain TERMINATING and terminationProtected is false
----

|*AWS Lightsail Instance does not restrict traffic on admin ports*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-152878

|This policy identifies the AWS Lightsail instance having network rule with unrestricted access ("0.0.0.0/0" or "::/0") on port 22 or 3389.

The firewall in Amazon Lightsail manages inbound traffic permitted to connect to your instance via its public IP address, controlling access to specific IPs and ports. Leaving administrative ports open to unrestricted access increases the risk of unauthorized access, such as brute-force attacks, which can compromise the instance and expose sensitive data.

It is recommended to *limit* access to specific IP addresses in the firewall rules to reduce unauthorized access attempts.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-lightsail-instance' AND json.rule = state.name contains "running" and networking.ports[?any( accessDirection equals inbound and (cidrs contains "0.0.0.0/0" or ipv6Cidrs contains "::/0") and (((toPort == 22 or fromPort == 22) or (toPort > 22 and fromPort < 22)) or ((toPort == 3389 or fromPort == 3389) or (toPort > 3389 and fromPort < 3389))))] exists
----

|*AWS Security Group allows all ingress traffic on CIFS port (445)*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-152814

|This policy identifies Security groups that allow all traffic on port 445 used by Common Internet File System (CIFS).

Common Internet File System (CIFS) is a network file-sharing protocol that allows systems to share files over a network. unrestricted CIFS access can expose your data to unauthorized users, leading to potential security risks.

It is recommended to restrict CIFS port 445 access to only trusted networks to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-ec2-describe-security-groups' AND json.rule = isShared is false and (ipPermissions[?any((ipRanges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 or ipv6Ranges[*].cidrIpv6 contains ::/0) and ((toPort == 445 or fromPort == 445) or (toPort > 445 and fromPort < 445)))] exists)
----

|*AWS Route53 Domain transfer lock is not enabled*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-152812

|This policy identifies the AWS Route53 domain which is not enabled with transfer lock.

Route 53 Domain Transfer Lock is a security feature that prevents unauthorised domain transfers by locking the domain at the registrar level. The feature sets the "clientTransferProhibited" flag, which is a registry setting enabled by the registrar to force all transfer requests to be rejected automatically. If Route 53 Domain Transfer Lock is disabled, your domain is vulnerable to unauthorized transfers, which can lead to service disruptions, data breaches, reputational damage, and financial loss.

It is recommended to enable Route 53 Domain Transfer Lock to prevent unauthorized domain transfers and protect your domain from potential security threats and disruptions.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-route53-domain' AND json.rule = statusList[*] does not contain "clientTransferProhibited"
----

|*Azure Microsoft Entra ID account lockout threshold greater than 10*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-152708

|This policy identifies if the account lockout threshold for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) accounts is configured to allow more than 10 failed login attempts before the account is locked out.

A high lockout threshold (greater than 10) increases the risk of brute-force or password spray attacks, where attackers can attempt multiple passwords over time without triggering account lockouts, leaving accounts vulnerable to unauthorized access. Setting the lockout threshold to a reasonable value (e.g., less than or equal to 10) balances usability and security by limiting the number of login attempts before an account is locked, reducing exposure to attacks while preventing frequent unnecessary lockouts for legitimate users.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to configure the account lockout threshold to less than or equal to 10.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-active-directory-group-settings' and json.rule = values[?any( name equals LockoutThreshold and (value greater than 10 or value does not exist))] exists
----

|*Azure Microsoft Entra ID account lockout duration less than 60 seconds*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-152755

|This policy identifies if the account lockout duration for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) accounts is configured to be less than 60 seconds. The lockout duration determines how long the account remains locked after exceeding the lockout threshold.

A lockout duration of less than 60 seconds increases the risk of brute-force or password spray attacks. Malicious actors can exploit a short lockout period to attempt multiple logins more frequently, increasing the likelihood of gaining unauthorized access. Configuring the lockout duration to be at least 60 seconds helps reduce the frequency of repeated login attempts during a brute-force attack, improving protection against such attacks while ensuring a reasonable delay for legitimate users after exceeding the threshold.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to configure the account lockout duration to greater than or equal to 60 seconds.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-active-directory-group-settings' and json.rule = values[?any(name equals LockoutDurationInSeconds and (value less than 60 or value does not exist))] exists
----

|*Azure disk data access authentication mode not enabled*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-152757

|This policy identifies if the Data Access Authentication Mode for Azure disks is disabled. This mode is crucial for controlling how users upload or export Virtual Machine Disks by requiring an Azure Entra ID role to authorize such operations.

Without enabling this mode, users can create SAS tokens to export disks without stringent identity-based restrictions. This increases the risk of unauthorized disk access or data exposure, especially in environments handling sensitive data. Enabling the Data Access Authentication Mode ensures that only users with the appropriate Data Operator for Managed Disk role in Azure Entra ID can export or manage disks. This enhances data security by preventing unauthorized disk exports and restricting access to secure download URLs.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to enable data access authentication mode for Azure disks.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-disk-list' AND json.rule = dataAccessAuthMode does not equal ignore case AzureActiveDirectory and managedBy contains virtualMachines and provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded
----

|*Azure App Service basic authentication enabled*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-152759

|This policy identifies Azure App Services which have basic authentication enabled.

Basic Authentication allows local identity management for App Services without using a centralized identity provider like Azure Entra ID, posing a security risk by creating isolated identity systems that lack centralized control and are vulnerable to credential compromise and unauthorized access. Disabling Basic Authentication and integrating with a centralized solution like Azure Entra ID enhances security with stronger authentication, improved access management, and reduced attack risks.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to disable basic authentication for Azure App Services.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-app-service-basic-publishing-credentials-policies' AND json.rule = properties.allow is true as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = properties.state equal ignore case Running as Y; filter '$.X.id contains $.Y.id'; show Y;
----

|*GCP Cloud Run function is using default service account with editor role*

tt:[24.12.1]
//RLP-152780

|This policy identifies GCP Cloud Run functions that are using the default service account with the editor role.

GCP Compute Engine Default service account is automatically created upon enabling the Compute Engine API. This service account is granted the IAM basic Editor role by default, unless explicitly disabled. Assigning default service account with the editor role to cloud run functions could lead to privilege escalation. Granting minimal access rights helps in promoting a better security posture.

|*GCP VM instance with the external IP address*
//RLP-153319

tt:[24.12.1]

|The policy description and recommendation steps are updated to provide better context. The policy RQL is updated to consider public IPv6 addresses assigned to GCP VM instances.

*Current Description–* 

This policy identifies the VM instances with the external IP address associated. To reduce your attack surface, VM instances should not have public/external IP addresses. Instead, instances should be configured behind load balancers, to minimize the instance's exposure to the internet.

NOTE: This policy will not report instances created by GKE because some of them have external IP addresses and cannot be changed by editing the instance settings. Instances created by GKE should be excluded. These instances have names that start with 'gke-' and contains 'default-pool'.

*Updated Description–*

This policy identifies GCP VM instances that are assigned a public IP.

Using a public IP with a GCP VM exposes it directly to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and attacks. This makes the VM vulnerable to threats such as brute force attempts, DDoS attacks, and other malicious activities. To mitigate these risks, it is safer to use private IPs and secure access methods like VPNs or load balancers.

It is recommended to avoid assigning public IPs to VM instances.
