|*RQL Available to Investigate Over-Privileged Access*

tt:[*24.5.2*]

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]
//IVG-14597

|The Permissions https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/search-and-investigate/permissions-queries/permissions-query-attributes[queries] are enhanced to include a new *grantedby.cloud.policy.isExcessive* attribute to identify excessive access in IAM policies across your AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud environments. 

|*Prisma Cloud Surfaces Third Party Vendor Account Information*

tt:[*24.5.2*]

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]
//RLP-139507

|Enhancements to Prisma Cloud's Search and Investigate functionality allow you to identify third-party vendors that may have access to service accounts and roles in your cloud environment. Explore and investigate third party vendor accounts in AWS with ease, leveraging account number to vendor matching look up. Use the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/search-and-investigate/permissions-queries/permissions-query-attributes[RQL query] examples to fine tune your search to surface vendor account information.

* To retrieve all known vendor accounts that have access to your environment:

`config from iam where source.cloud.account.isvendor = true` 

* To retrieve all vendor accounts with environment access that start with Red:

`config from iam where source.cloud.account STARTS WITH 'Red' and source.cloud.account.isvendor = true`

|*Risk Factors to Prioritize Your Code-to-Cloud Security*

tt:[*24.5.2*]

tt:[Secure the Source]
//BCE-27077

|Prisma Cloud now includes https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/application-security/risk-management/risk-indicators[Risk Factors] (Indicators) that help you prioritize security vulnerabilities by identifying critical elements within your development environment. Risk Factors focus specifically on deployed container images and the runtime-connected repositories they rely on. This prioritization is crucial because external exposure can increase the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and exploitation of vulnerabilities.

|*Custom Fix PR Titles and Branch Names*

tt:[*24.5.2*]

tt:[Secure the Source]
//BCE-32899

|You can now customize your https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/application-security/risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/fix-code-issues[pull request titles and branch names] for suggested fixes. This enables organizations to enforce a consistent naming convention, ensuring clear and contextual information about the purpose of the fix and makes it easier for team members to understand the changes being made.


|*Integration with Amazon Security Lake*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]
//RLP-136988

|Integrate Prisma Cloud with https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/administration/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/integrate-prisma-cloud-with-amazon-security-lake[Amazon Security Lake] to help your security analysts protect their cloud workloads, applications, and data with greater visibility and context into cloud security issues.

|*Enhanced Vulnerability Assessment*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-56841[Doc Ticket]CWP-48564[Eng Ticket]
//Moved from Update 4

|To enhance the accuracy of vulnerability assessments, Prisma Cloud has incorporated support for the 'Running On/With' configuration as outlined by NVD. This configuration, which integrates nodes based on both vulnerable and non-vulnerable criteria, requires specific conditions to be met, such as relevant packages or operating systems, for a vulnerability to be applicable. This enhancement allows Prisma Cloud to consider 'Running On/With' configurations that were not previously assessed. However, it is important to note that the impact of this enhancement is contingent on whether the CVE is assessed through NVD, as vulnerability information from the vendor feed is prioritized.

|*Serverless Defender support for Java 17 and 21*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-56785

|Added support for deploying Serverless Defender on Java 17 and Java 21 runtimes.

|*Support for Blocking Kubernetes cri-o Containers*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-57990

|For Kubernetes versions employing the latest versions of cri-o runtime, crun replaces runc for launching containers. To manage user-defined vulnerability and compliance blocking rules, however, Prisma Cloud uses, when such rules are present, a binary written in the Go language to proxy the crun runtime. This proxy blocks containers whenever vulnerabilities or compliance issues, as per user-defined rules, are detected. Prisma Cloud uses the original crun runtime for all other functionalities.

NOTE: If you want to run containers with a minimal number of processes, you cannot set a low PIDs limit, because the Go binary generates multiple threads. The original crun runtime does not have this limitation, as it is written in C.

|*OS-specific Evaluation for Go Packages*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-56790

|Prisma Cloud now evaluates operating system (OS) data for vulnerabilities detected in Go packages. This enhancement ensures that vulnerabilities are reported only if they meet the OS-specific criteria. For example, if vulnerabilities are detected in Go packages that are specific to Windows, they are reported only for Windows-based systems. They are not flagged for UNIX-based systems.

To view a detailed list of identified vulnerabilities, go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer.*

|*New Console Environment Variable for System Load Management*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-58081

|A new Console environment variable, REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS, has been added to prevent system overload issues when using the TAS applications with Defender.

Previously, Defender checked the state of TAS applications and containers every 10 seconds through an API call to the BBS server. However, frequent changes or restarts in applications within this duration could lead to system overload as Defender scanned all the apps that were impacted by the changes.

By setting a higher value for REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS, users can now reduce system load by decreasing the scanning frequency. For example, if REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS is set to 600 seconds, Defender checks for changes every 600 seconds, leading to a decrease in system load.

NOTE: Restart Defender for the REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS environment variable to take effect.

|*Support for Google Registry Scanning*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-57947

|When onboarding GCP cloud accounts, Prisma Cloud now supports scanning of Google Container Registry (GCR) and Google Artifact Registry (GAR).


|*Cloud Account Management*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-55308
|Introduced the *Account Import Status* filter on the *Cloud Accounts* page in *Runtime Security*.
This feature includes three statuses:

* *Local accounts:* Cloud accounts created in Runtime Security only (and not in the Prisma Cloud console)

* *Manually imported accounts:* Cloud accounts that were manually imported from Prisma Cloud console to Runtime Security in the past prior to the Lagrange release (end of 2022)

* *Auto-imported accounts:* Cloud accounts that originated from Prisma Cloud console and seamlessly imported into Runtime Security.

|This policy identifies AWS Network ACLs that are not in use. 

AWS Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) serve as a firewall mechanism to regulate traffic flow within and outside VPC subnets. A recommended practice is to assign NACLs to specific subnets to effectively manage network traffic. Unassigned NACLs with inadequate rules might inadvertently get linked to subnets, posing a security risk by potentially allowing unauthorized access.

It is recommended to regularly review and remove unused and inadequate NACLs to improve security, network performance, and resource management.

|*AWS AppSync has field-level logging disabled*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-137822

|This policy identifies an AWS AppSync GraphQL API not configured with field-level logging.

AWS AppSync is a managed GraphQL service that simplifies the development of scalable APIs. "field-level" security offers a fine-grained approach to defining permissions and access control for individual fields within a GraphQL schema. It allows precisely regulate which users or clients can read or modify specific fields in an API. This level of control ensures that sensitive data is protected and that access is restricted only to those with appropriate authorization.

Without field-level security, control over specific fields within the schema is lost, causing the risk of sensitive data exposure. Additionally, the absence of this feature limits the implementation of fine-grained access control policies based on user roles or contextual information, thereby undermining the overall security of the application.

It is recommended to enable field-level security to mitigate the risks by enforcing access control at a granular level, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify specific fields based on your defined policies and requirements.

|*AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment logging not configured*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-137508

|This policy identifies the Elastic Beanstalk environments not configured to send logs to CloudWatch Logs.

An Elastic Beanstalk environment is a configuration of AWS resources where you can deploy your application. The environment logs refer to the logs generated by various components of your application, which can provide valuable insights into any errors or issues that may arise during operation. Failing to enable logging in an Elastic Beanstalk environment reduces visibility, hinders incident detection and response, and increases vulnerability to security breaches.

It is recommended to configure AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments to send logs to CloudWatch to ensure security and meet compliance requirements.

|*AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) RSA certificate key length less than 2048*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-137507

|This policy identifies the RSA certificates managed by AWS Certificate Manager with a key length of less than 2048 bits. 

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a service for managing SSL/TLS certificates. RSA certificates are cryptographic keys used for securing communications over networks. Shorter key lengths may be susceptible to attacks such as brute force or factorization, where an attacker could potentially decrypt the encrypted data by finding the prime factors of the key.

It is recommended that the RSA certificates imported on ACM utilise a minimum key length of 2048 bits or greater to ensure a sufficient level of security.

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-136782

|This policy identifies GCP External Load Balancers using any of the protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2 having logging disabled.

GCP external load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances or services hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Feature "logging" for external load balancers captures and records detailed information about the traffic flowing through the load balancers. This includes data such as incoming requests, responses, errors, latency metrics, and other relevant information. By enabling logging for external load balancers, you gain visibility into the performance, health, and security of the applications. Logged data comes handy for troubleshooting an incident, monitoring, analysis, and compliance purposes.

It is recommended to enable logging for all external load balancers.

*Severity*â Low

*Policy Type*â Config

*Current Descriptionâ* This policy identifies Azure Virtual Network (VNet) subnets that are not associated with a Network Security Group (NSG). While binding an NSG to a network interface of a Virtual Machine (VM) enables fine-grained control to the VM, associating a NSG to a subnet enables better control over network traffic to all resources within a subnet. As a best practice, associate an NSG with a subnet so that you can protect your VMs on a subnet-level.

For more information, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/archive/blogs/igorpag/azure-network-security-groups-nsg-best-practices-and-lessons-learned[Azure Network Security Groups (NSG) - Best Practices and Lessons Learned] and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#limitations[What is a private endpoint? - Azure Private Link].

NOTE: This policy will not report for subnets used by Azure Firewall, Gateway, NetApp File Share, RouteServerSubnet, Private endpoints and Private links as Azure recommends not to configure Network Security Group (NSG) for these services.
