|*Enhanced Vulnerability Assessment*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-56841[Doc Ticket]CWP-48564[Eng Ticket]
//Moved from Update 4

|To enhance the accuracy of vulnerability assessments, Prisma Cloud has incorporated support for the 'Running On/With' configuration as outlined by NVD. This configuration, which integrates nodes based on both vulnerable and non-vulnerable criteria, requires specific conditions to be met, such as relevant packages or operating systems, for a vulnerability to be applicable. This enhancement allows Prisma Cloud to consider 'Running On/With' configurations that were not previously assessed. However, it is important to note that the impact of this enhancement is contingent on whether the CVE is assessed through NVD, as vulnerability information from the vendor feed is prioritized.

|*Serverless Defender support for Java 17 and 21*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-56785

|Added support for deploying Serverless Defender on Java 17 and Java 21 runtimes.

|*Support for Blocking Kubernetes cri-o Containers*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-57990

|For Kubernetes versions employing the latest versions of cri-o runtime, crun replaces runc for launching containers. To manage user-defined vulnerability and compliance blocking rules, however, Prisma Cloud uses, when such rules are present, a binary written in the Go language to proxy the crun runtime. This proxy blocks containers whenever vulnerabilities or compliance issues, as per user-defined rules, are detected. Prisma Cloud uses the original crun runtime for all other functionalities.

NOTE: If you want to run containers with a minimal number of processes, you cannot set a low PIDs limit, because the Go binary generates multiple threads. The original crun runtime does not have this limitation, as it is written in C.

|*OS-specific Evaluation for Go Packages*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-56790

|Prisma Cloud now evaluates operating system (OS) data for vulnerabilities detected in Go packages. This enhancement ensures that vulnerabilities are reported only if they meet the OS-specific criteria. For example, if vulnerabilities are detected in Go packages that are specific to Windows, they are reported only for Windows-based systems. They are not flagged for UNIX-based systems.

To view a detailed list of identified vulnerabilities, go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer.*

|*New Console Environment Variable for System Load Management*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-58081

|A new Console environment variable, REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS, has been added to prevent system overload issues when using the TAS applications with Defender.

Previously, Defender checked the state of TAS applications and containers every 10 seconds through an API call to the BBS server. However, frequent changes or restarts in applications within this duration could lead to system overload as Defender scanned all the apps that were impacted by the changes.

By setting a higher value for REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS, users can now reduce system load by decreasing the scanning frequency. For example, if REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS is set to 600 seconds, Defender checks for changes every 600 seconds, leading to a decrease in system load.

NOTE: Restart Defender for the REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS environment variable to take effect.

|*Support for Google Registry Scanning*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-57947

|When onboarding GCP cloud accounts, Prisma Cloud now supports scanning of Google Container Registry (GCR) and Google Artifact Registry (GAR).


|*Cloud Account Management*

tt:[*24.5.1*]

tt:[Secure the Runtime]
//CWP-55308
|Introduced the *Account Import Status* filter on the *Cloud Accounts* page in *Runtime Security*.
This feature includes three statuses:

* *Local accounts:* Cloud accounts created in Runtime Security only (and not in the Prisma Cloud console)

* *Manually imported accounts:* Cloud accounts that were manually imported from Prisma Cloud console to Runtime Security in the past prior to the Lagrange release (end of 2022)

* *Auto-imported accounts:* Cloud accounts that originated from Prisma Cloud console and seamlessly imported into Runtime Security.

|===
|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*AWS DocumentDB clusters have backup retention period less than 7 days*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-138075

|This policy identifies Amazon DocumentDB (DocDB) clusters lacking sufficient backup retention periods.

The backup retention period denotes the duration for storing automated backups of the DocumentDB cluster. Inadequate retention periods heighten the risk of data loss, compliance issues, and hinder effective recovery in security breaches or system failures.

The best practice is to ensure that there is a substantial backup retention period for DocDB clusters retaining at least 7 days of backups or according to your business and compliance requirements.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-docdb-db-cluster' AND json.rule = Status equals available and ( BackupRetentionPeriod does not exist or BackupRetentionPeriod less than 7 )
----

|*AWS DMS replication instance auto minor version upgrade is not enabled*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-138074

|This policy identifies the AWS DMS(Database Migration Service) replication instance does not enable auto minor version upgrade.

A replication instance in DMS is a compute resource used to replicate data between a source and target database during the migration or ongoing replication process. Failure to enable automatic minor upgrades in AWS DMS can leave your database instances vulnerable to security risks stemming from outdated software.

It is recommended to enable automatic minor version upgrades on DMS replication instances for instances that receive timely patches and updates, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities and improving overall performance and stability.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-dms-replication-instance' AND json.rule = replicationInstanceStatus equals "available" and autoMinorVersionUpgrade is false
----

|*AWS DynamoDB table deletion protection is disabled*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-137902

|This policy identifies AWS DynamoDB tables with deletion protection disabled. 

DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-latency database solution for applications that require consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. Deletion protection feature allows authorised administrators to prevent accidental deletion of DynamoDB tables. Enabling deletion protection helps reduce the risk of data loss, maintain data integrity, ensure compliance, and protect DynamoDB tables across different environments. 

It is recommended to enable deletion protection on DynamoDB tables to prevent unintended data loss.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-dynamodb-describe-table' AND json.rule = tableStatus equal ignore case ACTIVE and deletionProtectionEnabled is false
----

|*AWS DynamoDB table Auto Scaling not enabled*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-135128

|This policy identifies AWS DynamoDB tables with auto-scaling disabled.

DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-latency database solution for applications that require consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. Auto-scaling functionality allows you to dynamically alter the allocated throughput capacity for your DynamoDB tables based on current traffic patterns. This feature employs the Application Auto Scaling service to automatically boost provisioned read and write capacity to manage unexpected traffic increases and reduce throughput when the workload falls in order to avoid paying for wasted supplied capacity.

It is recommended to enable auto-scaling for the DynamoDB table to ensure efficient resource utilisation, cost optimisation, improved performance, simplified management, and scalability.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where Resource.status = Active AND api.name = 'aws-application-autoscaling-scaling-policy' as Y; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-dynamodb-describe-table' AND json.rule = tableStatus equal ignore case ACTIVE AND billingModeSummary.billingMode does not equal PAY_PER_REQUEST as X; filter 'not($.Y.ResourceName equals $.X.tableName)'; show X;
----

|*AWS Network ACL is not in use*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-137823

|This policy identifies AWS Network ACLs that are not in use. 

AWS Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) serve as a firewall mechanism to regulate traffic flow within and outside VPC subnets. A recommended practice is to assign NACLs to specific subnets to effectively manage network traffic. Unassigned NACLs with inadequate rules might inadvertently get linked to subnets, posing a security risk by potentially allowing unauthorized access.

It is recommended to regularly review and remove unused and inadequate NACLs to improve security, network performance, and resource management.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-network-acls' AND json.rule = associations[*] size less than 1
----

|*AWS AppSync has field-level logging disabled*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-137822

|This policy identifies an AWS AppSync GraphQL API not configured with field-level logging.

AWS AppSync is a managed GraphQL service that simplifies the development of scalable APIs. "field-level" security offers a fine-grained approach to defining permissions and access control for individual fields within a GraphQL schema. It allows precisely regulate which users or clients can read or modify specific fields in an API. This level of control ensures that sensitive data is protected and that access is restricted only to those with appropriate authorization.

Without field-level security, control over specific fields within the schema is lost, causing the risk of sensitive data exposure. Additionally, the absence of this feature limits the implementation of fine-grained access control policies based on user roles or contextual information, thereby undermining the overall security of the application.

It is recommended to enable field-level security to mitigate the risks by enforcing access control at a granular level, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify specific fields based on your defined policies and requirements.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-appsync-graphql-api' AND json.rule = logConfig.fieldLogLevel is not member of ('ERROR','ALL')
----

|*AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment logging not configured*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-137508

|This policy identifies the Elastic Beanstalk environments not configured to send logs to CloudWatch Logs.

An Elastic Beanstalk environment is a configuration of AWS resources where you can deploy your application. The environment logs refer to the logs generated by various components of your application, which can provide valuable insights into any errors or issues that may arise during operation. Failing to enable logging in an Elastic Beanstalk environment reduces visibility, hinders incident detection and response, and increases vulnerability to security breaches.

It is recommended to configure AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments to send logs to CloudWatch to ensure security and meet compliance requirements.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-environment' AND json.rule = status does not equal "Terminated" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-configuration-settings' AND json.rule = configurationSettings[*].optionSettings[?any( optionName equals "StreamLogs" and value equals "false" )] exists as Y; filter ' $.X.environmentName equals $.Y.configurationSettings[*].environmentName and $.X.applicationName equals $.Y.configurationSettings[*].applicationName'; show X;
----

|*AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) RSA certificate key length less than 2048*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-137507

|This policy identifies the RSA certificates managed by AWS Certificate Manager with a key length of less than 2048 bits. 

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a service for managing SSL/TLS certificates. RSA certificates are cryptographic keys used for securing communications over networks. Shorter key lengths may be susceptible to attacks such as brute force or factorization, where an attacker could potentially decrypt the encrypted data by finding the prime factors of the key.

It is recommended that the RSA certificates imported on ACM utilise a minimum key length of 2048 bits or greater to ensure a sufficient level of security.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-acm-describe-certificate' AND json.rule = status equals "ISSUED" and keyAlgorithm starts with "RSA-" and keyAlgorithm equals RSA-1024
----

|*AWS Macie is not enabled*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-137506

|This policy identifies the AWS Macie that is not enabled in specific regions. 

AWS Macie is a data security service that automatically discovers, classifies, and protects sensitive data in AWS, enhancing security and compliance posture. Failure to activate AWS Macie increases the risk of potentially missing out on automated detection and protection of sensitive data, leaving your organization more vulnerable to data breaches and compliance violations.

It is recommended to enable Macie in all regions for comprehensive adherence to security and compliance requirements.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-macie2-session' AND json.rule = status equals "ENABLED" as X; count(X) less than 1
----

|*GCP Cloud Asset Inventory is disabled*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-137627

|This policy identifies GCP accounts where GCP Cloud Asset Inventory is disabled.

GCP Cloud Asset Inventory is a metadata inventory service that allows you to view, monitor, and analyze Google Cloud and Anthos assets across projects and services. This data can prove to be crucial in security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing.

It is recommended to enable GCP Cloud Asset Inventory for centralized visibility and control over your cloud assets.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-services-list' AND json.rule = services[?any( name ends with "/cloudasset.googleapis.com" and state equals "ENABLED" )] does not exist
----

|*GCP External Load Balancer logging is disabled*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-136782

|This policy identifies GCP External Load Balancers using any of the protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2 having logging disabled.

GCP external load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances or services hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Feature "logging" for external load balancers captures and records detailed information about the traffic flowing through the load balancers. This includes data such as incoming requests, responses, errors, latency metrics, and other relevant information. By enabling logging for external load balancers, you gain visibility into the performance, health, and security of the applications. Logged data comes handy for troubleshooting an incident, monitoring, analysis, and compliance purposes.

It is recommended to enable logging for all external load balancers.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-external-backend-service' AND json.rule = backends exists and ( protocol equal ignore case "HTTP" or protocol equal ignore case "HTTPS" or protocol equal ignore case "HTTP2" ) and ( logConfig.enable does not exist or logConfig.enable is false )
----

|*GCP VM instance Confidential VM service disabled*

tt:[*24.5.1*]
//RLP-136757

|This policy identifies GCP VM instances that have confidential VM services disabled.

GCP VM encrypts data at rest and in transit, but the data must be decrypted before processing. Confidential VM service (Confidential Computing) allows GCP VM to keep in-memory data secure by utilizing hardware-based memory encryption. This protects any sensitive data leakage in case the VM is compromised.

It is recommended to enable confidential VM services on GCP VMs to enhance the confidentiality and integrity of in-memory data on the VMs.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-instances-list' AND json.rule = status equal ignore case "RUNNING" and (machineType contains "machineTypes/n2d-" or machineType contains "machineTypes/c2d-") and (confidentialInstanceConfig.enableConfidentialCompute does not exist or confidentialInstanceConfig.enableConfidentialCompute is false)
