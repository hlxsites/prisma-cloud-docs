|*Policies*
|*Description*


|*AWS Glue Job not encrypted by Customer Managed Key (CMK)*

tt:[*24.4.1*]

//RLP-135191
|This policy identifies AWS Glue jobs that are encrypted using the default KMS key instead of CMK (Customer Managed Key) or using the CMK that is disabled.

AWS Glue allows you to specify whether the data processed by the job should be encrypted when stored in data storage locations such as Amazon S3. To protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, users can specify CMK to get enhanced security, and control over the encryption key and also comply with any regulatory requirements.

It is recommended to use a CMK to encrypt the AWS Glue job data as it provides complete control over the encrypted data.

*Policy Severityâ* Medium

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-glue-job' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-glue-security-configuration' as Y; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' AND json.rule = keyMetadata.keyManager does not equal CUSTOMER or (keyMetadata.keyManager equals CUSTOMER and keyMetadata.keyState equals Disabled) as Z; filter '$.X.SecurityConfiguration does not exist or ( $.X.SecurityConfiguration equals $.Y.name and ($.Y.encryptionConfiguration.s3Encryption[*].s3EncryptionMode does not equal "SSE-KMS" or ($.Y.encryptionConfiguration.s3Encryption[*].kmsKeyArn exists and $.Y.encryptionConfiguration.s3Encryption[*].kmsKeyArn equals $.Z.keyMetadata.arn)))' ; show X;
----


|*AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Launch Configuration is not using encrypted EBS volumes*

tt:[*24.4.1*]

//RLP-135137

|This policy identifies AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Launch Configurations that are not using encrypted EBS volumes. 

A launch configuration defines an instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes allow you to create encrypted launch configurations when creating EC2 instances and auto scaling groups. When the entire EBS volume is encrypted, data stored at rest, in-transit, and snapshots are encrypted. This protects the data from unauthorized access. 

As a security best practice for data protection, enable encryption for all EBS volumes at auto scaling launch configuration.

*Policy Severityâ* Informational

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ec2-autoscaling-launch-configuration' AND json.rule = blockDeviceMappings[*].ebs exists AND blockDeviceMappings[?any(ebs.encrypted is false)] exists
----


|*AWS RDS cluster encryption in transit is not configured*

tt:[*24.4.1*]

//RLP-134801
|This policy identifies AWS RDS database clusters that are not configured with encryption in transit. This covers MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Aurora clusters.

Enabling encryption is crucial to protect data as it moves through the network and enhances the security between clients and storage servers. Without encryption, sensitive data transmitted between your application and the database is vulnerable to interception by malicious actors. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential compromises of confidential information.

It is recommended that data be encrypted while in transit to ensure its security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

*Policy Severityâ* Medium

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-rds-db-cluster' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-rds-db-cluster-parameter-group' AND json.rule = (((DBParameterGroupFamily starts with "postgres" or DBParameterGroupFamily starts with "aurora-postgresql") and (['parameters'].['rds.force_ssl'].['ParameterValue'] does not equal 1 or ['parameters'].['rds.force_ssl'].['ParameterValue'] does not exist)) or ((DBParameterGroupFamily starts with "aurora-mysql" or DBParameterGroupFamily starts with "mysql") and (parameters.require_secure_transport.ParameterValue is not member of ("ON", "1") or parameters.require_secure_transport.ParameterValue does not exist))) as Y; filter '$.X.dBclusterParameterGroupArn equals $.Y.DBClusterParameterGroupArn' ; show X;
----


|*AWS Secrets Manager secret not encrypted by Customer Managed Key (CMK)*

tt:[*24.4.1*]

//RLP-134724

|This policy identifies AWS Secrets Manager secrets that are encrypted using the default KMS key instead of CMK (Customer Managed Key) or using a CMK that is disabled.

AWS Secrets Manager secrets are a secure storage solution for sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and tokens in the AWS cloud. Secrets Manager secrets are encrypted by default by AWS managed key but users can specify CMK to get enhanced security, control over the encryption key, and also comply with any regulatory requirements.

As a security best practice, using CMK to encrypt your Secrets Manager secrets is advisable as it gives you full control over the encrypted data.

*Policy Severityâ* Low

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-secretsmanager-describe-secret' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' AND json.rule = keyMetadata.keyManager does not equal CUSTOMER or (keyMetadata.keyManager equals CUSTOMER and keyMetadata.keyState equals Disabled) as Y; filter '($.X.kmsKeyId does not exist ) or ($.X.kmsKeyId exists and $.X.kmsKeyId equals $.Y.keyMetadata.arn)'; show X;
----


|*AWS SageMaker endpoint data encryption at rest not configured*

tt:[*24.4.1*]

//RLP-129357

|This policy identifies AWS SageMaker Endpoints not configured with data encryption at rest.

AWS SageMaker Endpoint configuration defines the resources and settings for deploying machine learning models to SageMaker endpoints. By default, SageMaker Endpoints are not encrypted at rest. Enabling the encryption helps protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data on the storage volume attached to the ML compute instance that hosts the endpoint.

It is recommended to set encryption at rest to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

*Policy Severityâ* Low

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-sagemaker-endpoint-config' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' as Y; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-sagemaker-endpoint' AND json.rule = endpointStatus does not equal "Failed" as Z; filter '($.X.KmsKeyId does not exist or (($.X.KmsKeyId exists and $.Y.keyMetadata.keyState equals Disabled) and $.X.KmsKeyId equals $.Y.keyMetadata.arn)) and ($.X.EndpointConfigName equals $.Z.endpointConfigName)' ; show X;
----

|*AWS DMS replication instance is publicly accessible*

tt:[*24.4.1*]

//RLP-134709

|This policy identifies AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) replication instances with public accessibility enabled. 

A DMS replication instance is used to connect to your source data store, read the source data, and format the data for consumption by the target data store. When AWS DMS replication instances are publicly accessible and have public IP addresses, any machine outside the VPC can create a connection to these instances, increasing the attack surface and the possibility of malicious activity. 

So it is recommended to disable public accessibility of DMS replication instances to decrease the attack surface.

*Policy Severityâ* Low

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-dms-replication-instance' AND json.rule = replicationInstanceStatus is not member of ('creating','deleted','deleting') and publiclyAccessible is true
----

|*AWS Athena Workgroup not configured with data encryption at rest*

tt:[*24.4.1*]

//RLP-134306

|This policy identifies AWS Athena workgroups not configured with data encryption at rest.

AWS Athena workgroup enables you to isolate queries for you or your group of users from other queries in the same account, to set the query results location and the encryption configuration. By default, Athena workgroup query run results are not encrypted at rest and client side settings can override the workgroup settings. Encrypting workgroups and preventing overrides from the client side helps in protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the data stored on Athena.

It is recommended to set encryption at rest and enable 'override client-side settings' to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

*Policy Severityâ* Low

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-athena-workgroup' AND json.rule = WorkGroup.State equal ignore case enabled and (WorkGroup.Configuration.ResultConfiguration.EncryptionConfiguration does not exist or (WorkGroup.Configuration.EngineVersion.EffectiveEngineVersion contains Athena and WorkGroup.Configuration.EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration is false))
----

|*AWS root account activity detected in last 14 days*

tt:[*24.4.1*]

//RLP-131301

|This policy identifies if AWS root account activity was detected within the last 14 days. 

The AWS root account user is the primary administrative identity associated with an AWS account, providing complete access to all AWS services and resources. Since the root user has complete access to the account, adopting the principle of least privilege is important to lower the risk of unintentional disclosure of highly privileged credentials and inadvertent alterations. It's also advised to remove the root user access keys and restrict the use of the root user, refraining from using them for routine or administrative duties. 

It is recommended to restrict the use of the AWS root account.

*Policy Severityâ* Critical

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-iam-get-credential-report' AND json.rule = 'user equals "<root_account>" and ( _DateTime.ageInDays(access_key_1_last_used_date) < 14 or _DateTime.ageInDays(access_key_2_last_used_date) < 14 or _DateTime.ageInDays(password_last_used) < 14 )'
----

|*Azure Storage Sync Service configured with overly permissive network access*

tt:[*24.4.1*]

//RLP-58050

|This policy identifies Storage Sync Services configured with overly permissive network access. 

A Storage Sync Service is a management construct that represents registered servers and sync groups. Allowing all traffic to the Sync Service may allow a bad actor to brute force their way into the system and potentially get access to the entire network. With a private endpoint, the network traffic path is secured on both ends and access is restricted to only defined authorized entities. 

It is recommended to configure the Storage Sync Service with private endpoints to minimize the access vector.

*Policy Severityâ* Medium

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-storage-sync-service' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and properties.incomingTrafficPolicy equals AllowAllTraffic
----

|*GCP Storage Bucket encryption not configured with Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMEK)*

tt:[*24.4.1*]

//RLP-134725

|This policy identifies GCP Storage Buckets that are not configured with a Customer-Managed Encryption key. 

GCP Storage Buckets might contain sensitive information. Google Cloud Storage service encrypts all data within the buckets using Google-managed encryption keys by default but users can specify Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) to get enhanced security, control over the encryption key, and also comply with any regulatory requirements. 

As a security best practice, the use of CMK to encrypt your Storage bucket is advisable as it gives you full control over the encrypted data.

*Policy Severityâ* Low

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-storage-buckets-list' AND json.rule = encryption.defaultKmsKeyName does not exist
----
