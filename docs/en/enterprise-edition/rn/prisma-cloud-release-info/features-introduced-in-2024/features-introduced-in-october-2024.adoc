=== New Features

[cols="30%a,70%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Prisma Cloud Copilot*
//RLP-151264

tt:[24.10.1]

|Prisma Cloud Copilot provides you with an innovative way to interact with the Prisma Cloud platform through an AI chat interface. 
The Copilot is available for Prisma Cloud Enterprise customers on all Prisma Cloud stacks (except app.gov and app.cn). It will be a phased rollout from October 7, 2024 to October 24, 2024. 

Use Prisma Cloud Copilot for:

* Finding your top risks and easily prioritize and remediate the riskiest attack paths.

* Vulnerability management for surfacing top vulnerabilities, contextualizing CVEs, and recommending optimal fixes.

* Support case creation within the product.

* Finding answers instantly with natural language questions.


|*Satellite and Container Exposure*
//CNS-10225

tt:[24.10.1]

|Prisma Cloud now supports Kubernetes (K8s) service exposure, which detects containers directly exposed to the internet through a K8s Service and Network Load Balancer. Prisma Cloud correlates the K8s configuration with the VPC network information to determine which K8s components are internet exposed, the deployments and endpoints behind each service, based on which it builds a network graph to display the network path.

A new Prisma Cloud Satellite operator automatically deploys the Discovery application, which is used by Prisma Cloud to ingest K8s artifacts for analysis by Prisma Cloud Network Analyzer (CNA) and AppDNA. 


|*Application Centric Security Insights*
//RLP-119968

tt:[24.10.1]

|Prisma Cloud now allows you to review critical alerts and vulnerabilities from an application perspective. This provides visibility into all your impacted applications and their assets, helping you understand their relationships across your cloud environment and gain deeper insights into your security posture. 

Use the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/cloud-and-software-inventory/applications-inventory[Applications Inventory] page to inspect and analyze your applications. You can also search and investigate applications using the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/search-and-investigate/application-queries/application-queries[Application query attributes] available on the *Investigate* page.


 


|*AWS Role Chaining Detection*
//IVG-16193

tt:[24.10.1]

|Prisma Cloud Identity and Entitlement Management (CIEM) enhancements now allow you to be alerted when role chaining is present in your cloud environment. Role chaining occurs when you use a primary role to assume a secondary role. This results in the newly granted role assuming all the configured permissions granted for the first role. 

Granting a new identity, permissions that belong to a different role, to edit and run cloud resources may lead to a scenario where multiple roles and trust relationships lead to a privilege escalation. https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/search-and-investigate/permissions-queries/permissions-query-attributes[Role chaining detection] allows you to better detect and manage complex permissions configurations.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)*
//RLP-150134; Added in LA in 9.1; updated text in 9.2; move to Features Introduced in October > Changes in Existing Behavior.

|Starting with the current release, the format of `external_asset_id` for `aws-ecr-image` resources will change. As a result, all existing `aws-ecr-image` resources will be deleted in Prisma Cloud and the corresponding *Open* alerts will be resolved as *Closed*.

Prisma Cloud will automatically fetch all the live ECR images from your cloud accounts and create them as new resources with the new `external_asset_id` format. New alerts will be generated for resources that match the active policies in your tenant.

*Impact—* You may notice a temporary drop in `aws-ecr-image` resource count and open alert count. However, after the `aws-ecr-image` resources are automatically ingested, the corresponding live resource count and open alert count will return to the previous levels.

|*GCP API Update*

//RLP-150422

|*API*: gcloud-container-describe-clusters

*Change*: The Prisma cloud API will be updated to compute attributes "isMasterVersionSupported" and "isNodeVersionSupported" to provide results based on the latest improvements made by the GCP team with respect to the GetServerConfig API. This enhancement is planned to provide more accurate results for the alerts based on the default policies.

*Issue*: The default policies GCP GKE unsupported Master node version and GCP GKE unsupported node version are currently checking the GCP GKE version based on major and minor values. To provide accurate results, we are enhancing the Prisma API attribute to compare complete versions from the GCP API.

*Impact*: New alerts might be triggered based on the complete GKE version used for clusters and nodes.If you have custom policies, you must manually update them to check using the updated attribute.


|*VPC Peering Connections API Changes*

//RLP-150898

|*API*: aws-ec2-describe-vpc-peering-connections

*Change*: Ingestion of VPC peering connections will now be performed only for the requester account. This update will remove all related resources from the connection accepter account.


|*GCP Granular Permissions Addition*

//RLP-150820

|Starting with the current release, we will return all the granular permissions from viewer role under custom role, which are used for ingesting APIs. Viewer role will still be part of terraform. In addition, granular permissions will also be provided. which is similar to AWS.


// |*Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)*
//RLP-150134
// |Starting with the 24.10.1 release, the `external_asset_id` for `aws-ecr-image` in Prisma Cloud will be updated in the backend. As a result, all resources for `aws-ecr-image` API will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.
// Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Closed, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.
// *Impact—* You may notice a reduced count for the number of alerts. However, once the resources for the aws-ecr-image API resumes ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.


|*Amazon EC2 Ingestion*
//RLP-145171

|Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest private Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) owned by other accounts unless they are actively used by EC2 instances within the current account.

*Impact—* No impact on out-of-the-box (OOTB) policies. However, if you have custom policies, you must manually update them to check for private AMIs not owned by the same account and not currently deployed.

If you have any questions, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.

|*Alerts for Role Chaining*
//IVG-15421

|Enhancements to Prisma Cloud Identity and Entitlement Management (CIEM) capabilities alert users when role chaining is present in their environment. Role chaining occurs when you use a role to assume a second role. This results in the newly granted role assuming all the permissions granted to the first role.

*Impact—* To detect role chaining, new permissions will be created where AWS roles as the source serves as the principal of another role. These new permissions could lead to new alerts being generated, where they did not exist before.


|*Google Kubernetes Engine*
//RLP-150422, Check the fixversion again before moving the blurb in 10.1. The Fixversion may change to 11.1.

|Starting with the current release, the JSON resource attributes `isMasterVersionSupported` and `isNodeVersionSupported` for *gcloud-container-describe-clusters* API will be updated to align with the CSP *GetServerConfig* API. This change will provide accurate results for policy violation alerts related to the default policies— *GCP GKE unsupported Master node version* and *GCP GKE unsupported node version*.

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts. New alerts will be generated against policy violations based on the complete GKE version used for clusters and nodes. If you have custom policies, you must manually update them to receive the alerts.


|*Updates to GCP Terraform Template*
//RLP-150820

|Starting with the current release, a subset of Viewer role permissions needed for API ingestions will be added to the existing Custom role present in the Google Terraform template. Also, the original Viewer role containing necessary permissions will still be available in the template.

With this change, you need not manually enter the necessary API permissions under custom roles in case you decide not to grant Prisma Cloud Viewer role permissions.

*Impact—* This change will not affect the onboarding *Status* of your accounts.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*AWS EMR Studio using the shadow resource bucket for workspace storage*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-150584

|This policy identifies that the AWS EMR Studio using the bucket for workspace storage is not managed from the current account. This could potentially be using the shadow resource bucket for workspace storage.

AWS EMR enables data processing and analysis using big data frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, and Hive. To create an EMR Studio, the EMR service automatically generates an S3 bucket. This S3 bucket follows the naming pattern ‘aws-emr-studio-{Account-ID}-{Region}’. An attacker can create an unclaimed bucket with this predictable name and wait for the victim to deploy a new EMR Studio in a new region. This can result in multiple attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) when the user opens the compromised notebook in EMR Studio.

It is recommended to verify the expected bucket owner and update the AWS EMR storage location and enforce the aws: ResourceAccount condition in the policy of the service role used by the AWS EMR to check that the AWS account ID of the S3 bucket used by AWS EMR Studio according to your business requirements.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-emr-studio' AND json.rule = DefaultS3Location exists and DefaultS3Location contains "aws-emr-studio-" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' as Y; filter 'not ($.X.BucketName equals $.Y.bucketName)' ; show X;
----

|*AWS Glue Job using the shadow resource bucket for script location*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-150584

|This policy identifies that the AWS Glue Job using the bucket for script location is not managed from the current location. This could potentially be using the shadow resource bucket for script location.

A shadow resource bucket is an unauthorized S3 bucket posing security risks. AWS Glue is a service utilized to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, streamlining data preparation for analytics and machine learning. When a job is created using the Visual ETL tool, Glue automatically creates an S3 bucket with a predictable name pattern ‘aws-glue-assets-accountid-region’. An attacker could create the S3 bucket in any region before the victim uses Glue ETL, causing the victims Glue service to write files to the attacker-controlled bucket. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject any code into the Glue job of the victim, resulting in remote code execution (RCE).

It is recommended to verify the expected bucket owner and update the AWS Glue jobs script location and enforce the aws:ResourceAccount condition in the policy of the AWS Glue Job to check that the AWS account ID of the S3 bucket used by AWS Glue Job according to your business requirements.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-glue-job' AND json.rule = Command.BucketName exists and Command.BucketName contains "aws-glue-assets-" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = bucketName contains "aws-glue-assets-" as Y; filter 'not ($.X.Command.BucketName equals $.Y.bucketName)' ; show X;
----

|*Azure Machine Learning compute instance not configured inside virtual network*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-150351

|This policy identifies Azure Machine Learning compute instances that are not configured within a virtual network.

Azure Machine Learning compute instances outside a Virtual Network are exposed to external threats, as they may be publicly accessible. Placing the instance within a Virtual Network improves security by limiting access to trusted virtual machines and services within the same network. This ensures secure communication and blocks unauthorized public access.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to deploy the Azure Machine Learning compute instances inside a virtual network.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-machine-learning-compute' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and properties.properties.subnet.id does not exist
----

|*Azure Machine Learning compute instance with local authentication enabled*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-150352

|This policy identifies Azure Machine Learning compute instances that are using local authentication.

Disabling local authentication improves security by mandating the use of Microsoft Entra ID for authentication. Local authentication can lead to security risks and unauthorized access. Using Microsoft Entra ID ensures a more secure and compliant authentication process.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to disable local authentication and use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-machine-learning-compute' AND json.rule = properties.properties.state equal ignore case running and (properties.computeType equal ignore case ComputeInstance or properties.computeType equal ignore case AmlCompute ) and properties.disableLocalAuth is false 
----

|*Azure Machine Learning workspace not encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK)*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-150353

|This policy identifies Azure Machine Learning workspaces that are not encrypted with a Customer Managed Key (CMK).

Azure handles encryption using platform-managed keys by default, but customer-managed keys (CMKs) provide greater control and help meet specific security and compliance requirements. Without CMKs, organizations may not have full control over key management and rotation, increasing the risk of compliance issues and unauthorized data access. Configuring the workspace to use CMKs enhances security by allowing organizations to manage key access and rotation, ensuring stronger protection and compliance for sensitive data.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to configure the workspace to use Customer Managed Keys (CMKs).

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-machine-learning-workspace' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and (properties.encryption.status does not exist or properties.encryption.status equal ignore case disabled) 
----

|*Azure Machine Learning workspace not enforced with Managed Virtual Network Isolation*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-150354

|This policy identifies Azure Machine Learning workspaces that are not enforced with Managed Virtual Network Isolation.

Managed Virtual Network Isolation ensures that the workspace and its resources are accessible only within a secure virtual network. Without enforcing this isolation, the environment becomes vulnerable to security risks like external threats, data leaks, and non-compliance. If not properly isolated, the workspace may be exposed to public networks, increasing the chances of unauthorized access and data breaches.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to configure Azure Machine Learning workspaces with Managed Virtual Network Isolation. This will restrict network access to the workspace and ensure that it can only be accessed from authorized networks.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-machine-learning-workspace' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and (properties.managedNetwork.isolationMode equal ignore case Disabled OR properties.managedNetwork.isolationMode does not exist)
----


|*GCP public-facing (external) regional load balancer using HTTP protocol*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-147860

|This policy identifies GCP public-facing (external) regional load balancers using HTTP protocol.

Using HTTP protocol with a GCP external load balancer transmits data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping, interception, and modification by malicious actors. This lack of encryption exposes sensitive information, increases the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, and compromises the overall security and privacy of the data exchanged between clients and servers.

It is recommended to use HTTPS protocol with external-facing load balancers.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config


|*GCP public-facing (external) global load balancer using HTTP protocol*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-147861

|This policy identifies GCP public-facing (external) global load balancers using HTTP protocol.

Using the HTTP protocol with a GCP external load balancer transmits data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping, interception, and modification by malicious actors. This lack of encryption exposes sensitive information, increases the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, and compromises the overall security and privacy of the data exchanged between clients and servers.

It is recommended to use HTTPS protocol with external-facing load balancers.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config


|*GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instance is using default service account with the editor role*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-150416

|This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instances that are using the default service account with the Editor role.

The Compute Engine default service account is automatically created with an autogenerated name and email address when you enable the Compute Engine API. By default, this service account is granted the IAM basic Editor role unless you explicitly disable this behavior. If this service account is assigned to a Vertex AI Workbench instance, it may lead to potential privilege escalation.

In line with the principle of least privilege, it is recommended that Vertex AI Workbench Instances are not assigned the 'Compute Engine default service account', particularly when the Editor role is granted to the service account.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-vertex-ai-workbench-instance' AND json.rule = state equals "ACTIVE" and gceSetup.serviceAccounts[*].email contains "compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-projects-get-iam-user' AND json.rule = user contains "compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" and roles[*] contains "roles/editor" as Y; filter ' $.X.gceSetup.serviceAccounts[*].email equals $.Y.user'; show X;
----

|*GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instance has vTPM disabled*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-150417

|This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instances that have the Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) feature disabled.

The Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) validates the guest VM's pre-boot and boot integrity and provides key generation and protection. The root keys of the vTPM, as well as the keys it generates, cannot leave the vTPM, thereby offering enhanced protection against compromised operating systems or highly privileged project administrators.

It is recommended to enable the virtual TPM device on GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instances to support measured boot and other OS security features that require a TPM.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

|*GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instance has Integrity monitoring disabled*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-150420

|This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instances that have Integrity monitoring disabled.

Integrity Monitoring continuously monitors the boot integrity, kernel integrity, and persistent data integrity of the underlying VM of the shielded workbench instances. It detects unauthorized modifications or tampering, enhancing security by verifying the trusted state of VM components throughout their lifecycle. Integrity monitoring provides active alerts, enabling administrators to respond to integrity failures and prevent compromised nodes from being deployed into the cluster.

It is recommended to enable Integrity Monitoring for Workbench instances to detect and mitigate advanced threat, such as rootkits and bootkit malware.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

[#iam-policy-updates]
=== IAM Policy Updates

The policy *Severity* levels for the following IAM policies will be adjusted to better align with the potential risks they pose.

*Impact—* If your alert rules use the *Policy Severity* filter, you may notice a slight change in the number of alerts. However, this change will not affect custom policies or policies where you have manually set the severity levels. For policies included in alert rules that are not based on severity, the number of alerts will remain unchanged.

If you have any questions, reach out to your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.

|*Description*

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*Azure Storage Account without Secure transfer enabled*
//RLP-149572

tt:[24.10.1]

|*Changes—* The policy description and RQL will be updated to ignore storage accounts where the secure transfer property is not applicable for NFS Azure file shares to work.

*Current Description—* This policy identifies Storage accounts which have Secure transfer feature disabled. The secure transfer option enhances the security of your storage account by only allowing requests to the storage account by a secure connection. When 'secure transfer required' is enabled, REST APIs to access your storage accounts connect using HTTPs any requests using HTTP will be rejected. When you are using the Azure files service, connection without encryption will fail. It is highly recommended to enable secure transfer feature on your storage account.

NOTE: Azure storage doesn't support HTTPs for custom domain names, this option is not applied when using a custom domain name.

*Updated Description—* This policy identifies Storage accounts which have Secure transfer feature disabled. The secure transfer option enhances the security of your storage account by only allowing requests to the storage account by a secure connection. 

When "secure transfer required" is disabled, REST APIs to access your storage accounts may connect over insecure HTTP which is not advised. Hence, it is highly recommended to enable secure transfer feature on your storage account.

NOTE: Azure storage doesn't support HTTPs for custom domain names, this option is not applied when using a custom domain name. Additionally, this property is not applicable for NFS Azure file shares to work.

*Current RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = properties.supportsHttpsTrafficOnly !exists or properties.supportsHttpsTrafficOnly is false
----

*Updated RQL—*

|*Change*
|*Description*

|tt:[*End of support for Google Cloud Function v1 API*]
//RLP-142340

|`gcloud-cloud-function-v1` API is planned for deprecation. Due to this change, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest metadata for `gcloud-cloud-function-v1 API`.

|The following API endpoints will be deprecated as of this release:

* https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/get-resource/[GET/resource]
* https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/get-timeline-for-resource/[POST /resource/timeline]
* https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/get-resource-raw/[POST /resource/raw]

The API's above will be replaced by the following new endpoint:
