|*Description*


|*Prisma Cloud Release Schedule Updated from a Bi-weekly to a Monthly Release*
//RLP-148595

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, Prisma Cloud release schedule will transition from a bi-weekly to a monthly cadence to ensure continuous deliver of high-quality features and enhancements.

* Enhance Quality: A longer development cycle enables the Prisma Cloud team to focus on thorough testing and quality assurance, ensuring that each release meets the highest standards.

* Incorporate Feedback: With more time between releases, we can better integrate your feedback and suggestions into our product roadmap, leading to features that truly meet your organization's security needs.

* Optimize Resources: This change helps allocate resources more effectively, allowing the Prisma Cloud team to work on more feature improvements for you.

*Impact—* Prisma Cloud will release new features, enhancements, and security updates on a monthly basis starting in October 2024 (no more .2 releases). Each release will be accompanied by detailed release notes to keep you informed of what's new.

If you have any questions or feedback, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Support representative.

//Thank You for your support and we appreciate your understanding and support as we make this transition. Our goal is to provide you with the best possible product and experience. If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out to our support team.
//Improved Communication: We are committed to continue keeping you updated on our progress and any upcoming features. Expect regular updates and insights into our development process.

| *Lifecycle Support Update*

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.00.169]

//CWP-61282

| Prisma Cloud officially guarantees backward compatibility with up to two previous major versions (N-2).

Although the support lifecycle remains unchanged, starting from version 33.xx, Prisma Cloud will not restrict the usage of Defender versions or REST API calls from up to three major releases before the current version (upto N-3 major releases).

For example, with the current version at 33.xx, API calls and Defenders from version 30.xx will be allowed. However, support and complete backward compatibility is guaranteed for the 32.xx and 31.xx releases.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)*
//RLP-150134; Added in LA in 9.1; updated text in 9.2; move to Features Introduced in October > Changes in Existing Behavior.

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, the format of `external_asset_id` for `aws-ecr-image` resources will change. As a result, all existing `aws-ecr-image` resources will be deleted in Prisma Cloud and the corresponding *Open* alerts will be resolved as *Closed*.

Prisma Cloud will automatically fetch all the live ECR images from your cloud accounts and create them as new resources with the new `external_asset_id` format. New alerts will be generated for resources that match the active policies in your tenant.

*Impact—* You may notice a temporary drop in `aws-ecr-image` resource count and open alert count. However, after the `aws-ecr-image` resources are automatically ingested, the corresponding live resource count and open alert count will return to the previous levels.

|*GCP API Update*

//RLP-150422

*API*: gcloud-container-describe-clusters

*Issue*:

The default policies GCP GKE unsupported Master node version and GCP GKE unsupported node version are currently checking the GCP GKE version based on major and minor values. To provide accurate results, we are enhancing the Prisma API attribute to compare complete versions from the GCP API.

*Change*:

The Prisma cloud API will be updated to compute attributes "isMasterVersionSupported" and "isNodeVersionSupported" to provide results based on the latest improvements made by the GCP team with respect to the GetServerConfig API. This enhancement is planned to provide more accurate results for the alerts based on the default policies

*Impact*:

New alerts might be triggered based on the complete GKE version used for clusters and nodes.

If you have custom policies, you must manually update them to check using the updated attribute.

|*VPC Peering Connections API Changes*

//RLP-150898

|*API*: aws-ec2-describe-vpc-peering-connections

*Change*: Ingestion of VPC peering connections will now be performed only for the requester account. This update will remove all related resources from the connection accepter account.


|*GCP Granular Permissions Addition*

//RLP-150820

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, we will return all the granular permissions from viewer role under custom role, which are used for ingesting APIs. Viewer role will still be part of terraform. In addition, granular permissions will also be provided. which is similar to AWS.


// |*Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)*
//RLP-150134
// |Starting with the 24.10.1 release, the `external_asset_id` for `aws-ecr-image` in Prisma Cloud will be updated in the backend. As a result, all resources for `aws-ecr-image` API will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.
// Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Closed, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.
// *Impact—* You may notice a reduced count for the number of alerts. However, once the resources for the aws-ecr-image API resumes ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.


|*Amazon EC2 Ingestion*
//RLP-145171

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest private Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) owned by other accounts unless they are actively used by EC2 instances within the current account.

*Impact—* No impact on out-of-the-box (OOTB) policies. However, if you have custom policies, you must manually update them to check for private AMIs not owned by the same account and not currently deployed.

If you have any questions, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.

|*Alerts for Role Chaining*
//IVG-15421

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, enhancements to Prisma Cloud Identity and Entitlement Management (CIEM) capabilities will alert users when role chaining is present in their environment. Role chaining occurs when you use a role to assume a second role. This results in the newly granted role assuming all the permissions granted to the first role.

*Impact—* To detect role chaining, new permissions will be created where AWS roles as the source serves as the principal of another role. These new permissions could lead to new alerts being generated, where they did not exist before.


|*Google Kubernetes Engine*
//RLP-150422, Check the fixversion again before moving the blurb in 10.1. The Fixversion may change to 11.1.

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, the JSON resource attributes `isMasterVersionSupported` and `isNodeVersionSupported` for *gcloud-container-describe-clusters* API will be updated to align with the CSP *GetServerConfig* API. This change will provide accurate results for policy violation alerts related to the default policies— *GCP GKE unsupported Master node version* and *GCP GKE unsupported node version*.

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts. New alerts will be generated against policy violations based on the complete GKE version used for clusters and nodes. If you have custom policies, you must manually update them to receive the alerts.


|*Updates to GCP Terraform Template*
//RLP-150820

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, a subset of Viewer role permissions needed for API ingestions will be added to the existing Custom role present in the Google Terraform template. Also, the original Viewer role containing necessary permissions will still be available in the template.

With this change, you need not manually enter the necessary API permissions under custom roles in case you decide not to grant Prisma Cloud Viewer role permissions.

*Impact—* This change will not affect the onboarding *Status* of your accounts.

|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*AWS S3 bucket used for storing AWS Bedrock Custom model training artifacts*

tt:[24.10.1]
//RLP-149533

|This policy identifies the AWS S3 bucket used for storing AWS Bedrock Custom model training job output.

S3 buckets hold the results and artifacts generated from training models in AWS Bedrock. Ensuring proper configuration and access control is crucial to maintaining the security and integrity of the training output. Improperly secured S3 buckets used for storing AWS Bedrock training output can lead to unauthorized access and potential exposure of model information.

It is recommended to implement strict access controls, enable encryption, and audit permissions to secure AWS S3 buckets for AWS Bedrock training job output and ensure compliance.

NOTE: This policy is designed to identify the S3 buckets utilized for storing results and storing artifacts generated from training custom models in AWS Bedrock. It does not signify any detected misconfiguration or security risk.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-bedrock-custom-model' as Y; filter ' $.Y.outputDataConfig.bucketName equals $.X.bucketName'; show X;

[#iam-policy-update]
=== IAM Policy Updates

The policy *Severity* levels for the following IAM policies will be adjusted to better align with the potential risks they pose.

*Impact—* If your alert rules use the *Policy Severity* filter, you may notice a slight change in the number of alerts. However, this change will not affect custom policies or policies where you have manually set the severity levels. For policies included in alert rules that are not based on severity, the number of alerts will remain unchanged.

If you have any questions, reach out to your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.

|*Azure App Service Web app doesn't use latest TLS version*
//RLP-148541

tt:[24.9.1]

|*Changes—* The updated Policy RQL will not alert for minTlsVersion of 1.3.

*Current Description—* This policy identifies Azure web apps which are not set with latest version of TLS encryption. App service currently allows the web app to set TLS versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. It is highly recommended to use the latest TLS 1.2 version for web app secure connections.

*Updated Description—* This policy identifies Azure web apps that are not configured with the latest version of TLS encryption. Azure Web Apps provide a platform to host and manage web applications securely. 

Using the latest TLS version is crucial for maintaining secure connections. Older versions of TLS, such as 1.0 and 1.1, have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. Upgrading to newer versions like TLS 1.2 or 1.3 ensures that the web app is better protected against modern security threats.

It is highly recommended to use the latest TLS version (greater than 1.1) for secure web app connections.

*Current RQL—*
