|*GCP Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebook has Integrity monitoring disabled*

tt:[*24.6.1*]
//RLP-139233

|This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks that have Integrity monitoring disabled.

Integrity Monitoring continuously monitors the boot integrity, kernel integrity, and persistent data integrity of the underlying VM of the shielded user-managed notebooks. It detects unauthorized modifications or tampering, enhancing security by verifying the trusted state of VM components throughout their lifecycle. It provides active alerting allowing administrators to respond to integrity failures and prevent compromised nodes from being deployed into the cluster.

It is recommended to enable integrity monitoring for user-managed notebooks to detect and mitigate advanced threats like rootkits and bootkit malware.

|*GCP Cloud Run service revision is using default service account with editor role*

tt:[*24.6.1*]
//RLP-140681

|This policy identifies GCP Cloud Run service revisions that are utilizing the default service account with the editor role. 

GCP Compute Engine Default service account is automatically created upon enabling the Compute Engine API. This service account is granted the IAM basic Editor role by default, unless explicitly disabled. Assigning default service account with the editor role to cloud run revisions could lead to privilege escalation. Granting minimal access rights helps in promoting a better security posture.

Following the principle of least privileges, it is recommended to avoid assigning default service account with the editor role to cloud run revision.

|*OCI Cloud Guard is not enabled in the root compartment of the tenancy*

tt:[*24.6.1*]
//RLP-140442

|This policy identifies the absence of OCI Cloud Guard enablement in the root compartment of the tenancy.

OCI Cloud Guard is a vital service that detects misconfigured resources and insecure activities within an OCI tenancy. It offers security administrators visibility to identify and resolve these issues promptly. Cloud Guard not only detects but also suggests, assists, or takes corrective actions to mitigate security risks. By enabling Cloud Guard in the root compartment of the tenancy with default configuration, activity detectors, and responders, administrators can proactively monitor and secure their OCI resources against potential security threats.

As best practice, it is recommended to have Cloud Guard enabled in the root compartment of your tenancy.

|*OCI boot volume is not encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK)*

tt:[*24.6.1*]
//RLP-140443

|This policy identifies OCI boot volumes that are not encrypted with a Customer Managed Key (CMK).

Encrypting boot volumes with a CMK enhances data security by providing an additional layer of protection. Effective management of encryption keys is crucial for safeguarding and accessing sensitive data. Customers should review boot volumes encrypted with Oracle service managed keys to determine if they prefer managing keys for specific volumes and implement their own key lifecycle management accordingly.

As best practice, it is recommended to encrypt OCI boot volumes using a Customer Managed Key (CMK) to strengthen data security measures.

|*End of support for Azure Data Lake Analytics and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 Services*

//RLP-134902, RLP-127361

|N/A
|24.6.1

|The following APIs are planned for deprecation because Azure has announced the retirement of Azure Data Lake Analytics and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 Services. Due to this, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest metadata for the following APIs:

* azure-data-lake-analytics-account
* azure-data-lake-analytics-diagnostic-settings
* azure-data-lake-store-gen1-account
* azure-data-lake-store-gen1-diagnostic-settings

In RQL, the key will not be available in the `api.name` attribute auto-completion.

*Impact*—If you have a saved search or custom policies based on this API, you must delete those manually. The policy alerts will be resolved as Policy_Deleted.
