|*Data Security Posture Management and Artificial Intelligence Security Posture Management*

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.8.1] 

|Prisma Cloud Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and Artificial Intelligence Security Posture Management (AI-SPM) are now generally available.

* https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/data-security-posture-management/welcome/welcome[DSPM] enables you to discover, classify, protect, and govern data across your cloud environments.

* https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/data-security-posture-management/welcome-to-prisma-cloud-aispm/introduction-ai[AI-SPM] provides complete visibility in to your AI pipelines. It prioritizes misconfigurations and strengthens the overall integrity of your AI framework and minimizes the risk of data exposure and compliance breaches.

|*DSPM Permissions and Default Permission Group*
//RLP-146508, RLP-147749

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.8.1] 

|Prisma Cloud includes a new *Data Security Posture Management* permission that allows you to grant access to all the  DSPM capabilities for Custom Permission Groups. For ease of use, Prisma Cloud also has a new *Data Security Posture Management* Default Permission Group, which includes this new permission. 

|*AI Assisted Queries*
//RLP-146585, - To Do, JJ to share the doc link

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.8.1]

|Enhancements to Prisma Cloud's query launcher allow you to use https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/search-and-investigate/launch-your-query[AI assisted queries] to retrieve saved searches from your current tenant. Going beyond keyword matching, AI powered semantic searches provide ease of use when launching investigations in Prisma Cloud. For instance, typing “public facing” as a query, returns results with “reachable from untrusted internet sources” as well, because the saved search matches the meaning of the query "public facing". AI assisted search can be toggled on and off as needed. Use the feedback buttons as shown in the image below to provide your feedback on this feature.

|*RQL for AWS Access Key Discovery*
//RLP-146594

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.8.1] 

|Prisma Cloud's RQL enhancements help you discover detailed information about Access Keys held by users, their activity, rotation, and usage. Available for AWS, the following RQL query helps you enforce zero trust best practices in your cloud environment:

* Queries the number of days passed since the last usage of an access key

`source.cloud.accesskey.lastused.days (>, <, = )`

* Queries the number of active access keys held by a user

`source.cloud.accesskey.activekeys (<, >, =) (0, 1, 2)`

|tt:[Update] *Cloud Network Analyzer*
//RLP-144795

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.8.1] 

|Prisma Cloud *AWS EC2 instance with unrestricted outbound access to internet* CNA policy now ignores resources created by Prisma Cloud agentless scanning as those are very well restricted and short lived workloads that can only communicate back with Prisma Cloud.


|tt:[Update] *Vulnerability Dashboard*
//RLP-135217

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.8.1] 

|Vulnerability Dashboard now supports cloud account and cluster/namespace filters.

|*Multiselect Disabled for Alert Rule Name Filter*
//RLP-147561

tt:[24.8.2] 

|You cannot select multiple alert rules in the *Alert Rule Name* filter on the *Alerts > Overview* page. The multiselect option is disabled to eliminate inconsistent results when filtering more than one alert rule. 

When using the `POST/alerts/policy` API, make sure to include only one *Alert Rule Name* in the filters attribute of the request body schema.

|*Role-Based Access Control for Compliance and Alert Reports*
//RLP-140182

tt:[24.8.1]

|User-generated reports are only visible to System Administrators and to users with the same role.

Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enhances data security by streamlining report access for users with the same role, while also preventing unauthorized access.

|*Create or Update Policy Permissions*
//RLP-139027

tt:[24.8.1]

|The Create/Update Policy Permissions are divided into the two granular permissions as follows:

* Policy
* Manage Policy Compliance Mapping

*Impact—* 

* Users managing new custom permission groups must select both permissions explicitly if they want to assign compliance mappings during policy create/update operation.
* Manage policy compliance mapping is added by default to all existing permission groups with policy create/update permissions.

|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*AWS API Gateway REST API execution logging disabled*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-147676

|This policy identifies AWS API Gateway REST API's that have disabled execution logging in their stages.

AWS API Gateway REST API is a service for creating and managing RESTful APIs integrated with backend services like Lambda and HTTP endpoints. Execution logs all the API activity logs to CloudWatch, which helps in incident response, security and compliance, troubleshooting, and monitoring. 

It is recommended to enable logging on the API Gateway REST API to track API activity. 

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-apigateway-get-stages' AND json.rule = methodSettings.[].loggingLevel does not exist OR methodSettings.[].loggingLevel equal ignore case off as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-apigateway-get-rest-apis' as Y; filter ' $.X.restApi equal ignore case $.Y.id '; show Y;
----

|*AWS S3 access point Block public access setting disabled*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-147675

|This policy identifies AWS S3 access points with the block public access setting disabled.

AWS S3 Access Point simplifies managing data access by creating unique access control policies for specific applications or users within a S3 bucket. The Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature manages access at the account, bucket, and access point levels. Each level's settings can be configured independently but cannot override more restrictive settings at higher levels. Instead, access point settings complement those at the account and bucket levels.

It is recommended to enable the Block public access setting on a S3 access point unless intended for public exposure.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-s3-access-point' AND json.rule = networkOrigin equal ignore case internet and (publicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist or (publicAccessBlockConfiguration.blockPublicAcls is false and publicAccessBlockConfiguration.ignorePublicAcls is false and publicAccessBlockConfiguration.blockPublicPolicy is false and publicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false))
----

|*AWS Secrets Manager secret configured with automatic rotation not rotated as scheduled*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-147729

|This policy identifies the AWS Secrets Manager secret not rotated successfully based on the rotation schedule.

Secrets Manager stores secrets centrally, encrypts them automatically, controls access, and rotates secrets safely. By rotating secrets, you replace long-term secrets with short-term ones, limiting the risk of unauthorized use. If secrets fail to rotate in Secrets Manager, long-term secrets remain in use, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

It is recommended that proper configuration and monitoring of the rotation process be ensured to mitigate these risks.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-secretsmanager-describe-secret' AND json.rule = 'lastRotatedDate exists and rotationEnabled is true and _DateTime.daysBetween($.lastRotatedDate,today()) > $.rotationRules.automaticallyAfterDays'
----

|*AWS S3 bucket with cross-account access*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-147726

|This policy identifies the AWS S3 bucket policy allows one or more of the actions (s3:DeleteBucketPolicy, s3:PutBucketAcl, s3:PutBucketPolicy, s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration, s3:PutObjectAcl) for a principal in another AWS account.

An S3 bucket policy that defines permissions and conditions for accessing an Amazon S3 bucket and its objects. Granting permissions like s3:DeleteBucketPolicy, s3:PutBucketAcl, s3:PutBucketPolicy, s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration, and s3:PutObjectAcl to other AWS accounts can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

It is recommended to review and remove permissions from the S3 bucket policy by deleting statements that grant access to restricted actions for other AWS accounts.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal.AWS does not equal * and Principal does not equal * and Principal.AWS contains arn and Principal.AWS does not contain $.accountId) and (Action contains "s3:Put*" or Action contains "s3:Delete*" or Action equals "*" or Action contains "s3:*" or Action is member of ('s3:DeleteBucketPolicy','s3:PutBucketAcl','s3:PutBucketPolicy','s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration','s3:PutObjectAcl') ))] exists
----


|*AWS Lambda Function with administrative permissions*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-147712

|This policy identifies Lambda Functions granted administrative permissions, increasing the blast radius in case of a potential compromise of the function.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* IAM

*Policy Subtype—* Permissions

----
config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' AND action.access.isAdministrative = true AND source.cloud.service.name = 'lambda'
----


|*Azure Function App with administrative permissions*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-147712

|This policy identifies	Function App instances granted administrative permissions, increasing the blast radius in case of a potential compromise of the function.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* IAM

*Policy Subtype—* Permissions

----
config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'AZURE' AND action.access.isAdministrative = true and source.cloud.service.name = 'microsoft.web'
----

|*Azure Database for MySQL flexible server public network access setting is enabled*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-36847

|This policy identifies Azure Database for MySQL flexible servers which have public network access setting enabled.

Publicly accessible MySQL servers are vulnerable to external threats with risk of unauthorized access or may remotely exploit any vulnerabilities.

As a best security practice, it is recommended to configure the MySQL servers with IP-based strict server-level firewall rules or virtual-network rules or private endpoints so that servers are accessible only to restricted entities.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-mysql-flexible-server' AND json.rule = properties.state equal ignore case Ready and firewallRules[*] is empty and properties.network.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled 
----

|*Azure Database for MySQL flexible server firewall rule allow access to all IPv4 address*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-36845

|This policy identifies Azure Database for MySQL flexible servers which have firewall rule allowing access to all IPV4 address.

MySQL server having a firewall rule with start IP being 0.0.0.0 and end IP being 255.255.255.255 (i.e. all IPv4 addresses) would allow access to server from any host on the internet. Allowing access to all IPv4 addresses expands the potential attack surface and exposes the MySQL server to increased threats.Allowing access to all IPv4 addresses expands the potential attack surface and exposes the MySQL server to increased threats.

As a best security practice, it is recommended to configure the MySQL servers with restricted IP-based server-level firewall rules so that servers are accessible only to restricted entities.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-mysql-flexible-server' AND json.rule = properties.state equal ignore case Ready and properties.network.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled and firewallRules[?any(properties.startIpAddress equals 0.0.0.0 and properties.endIpAddress equals 255.255.255.255)] exists
----

|*Azure Event Hub Namespace having authorization rules except RootManageSharedAccessKey*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-36090

|This policy identifies Azure Event Hub Namespaces which have authorization rules except RootManageSharedAccessKey.

Having Azure Event Hub namespace authorization rules other than 'RootManageSharedAccessKey' could provide access to all queues and topics under the namespace which pose a risk if these additional rules are not properly managed or secured.

As best practice, it is recommended to remove Event Hub namespace authorization rules other than RootManageSharedAccessKey and create access policies at the entity level, which provide access to only that specific entity for queues and topics.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-event-hub-namespace' AND json.rule = authorizationRules[*].name exists and authorizationRules[?any(name does not equal RootManageSharedAccessKey)] exists
----

|*Azure Event Hub Instance not defined with authorization rule*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-36089

|This policy identifies Azure Event Hub Instances that are not defined with authorization rules.

If the Azure Event Hub Instance authorization rule is not defined, there is a heightened risk of unauthorized access to the event hub data and resources. This could potentially lead to unauthorized data retrieval, tampering, or disruption of the event hub operations. Defining proper authorization rules helps mitigate these risks by controlling and restricting access to the event hub resources.

As a best practice, it is recommended to define the least privilege security model access policies at Event Hub Instance.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-event-hub-namespace' AND json.rule = properties.disableLocalAuth is false as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-event-hub' AND json.rule = properties.status equal ignore case ACTIVE and authorizationRules[*] is empty as Y; filter '$.Y.id contains $.X.name'; show Y;
----

|*Azure user not restricted to create Microsoft Entra Security Group*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-147323

|This policy identifies instances in the Microsoft Entra ID configuration where security group creation is not restricted to administrators only.

When the ability to create security groups is enabled, all users in the directory can create new groups and add members to them. Unless there is a specific business need for this broad access, it is best to limit the creation of security groups to administrators only.

As a best practice, it is recommended to restrict the ability to create Microsoft Entra Security Groups to administrators only.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = defaultUserRolePermissions.allowedToCreateSecurityGroups is true
----

|*Azure Guest User Invite not restricted to users with specific admin role*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-147320

|This policy identifies instances in the Microsoft Entra ID configuration where guest user invitations are not restricted to specific administrative roles.

Allowing anyone in the organization, including guests and non-admins, to invite guest users can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This unrestricted access poses a significant security risk.

As a best practice, it is recommended to configure guest user invites to specific admin roles. This will ensure that only authorized personnel can invite guests, maintaining tighter control over access to cloud resources.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = not (allowInvitesFrom equal ignore case adminsAndGuestInviters OR allowInvitesFrom equal ignore case none)
----

|*Azure Machine learning compute instance configured with public IP*

tt:[24.8.2]
//RLP-146434

|This policy identifies Azure Machine Learning compute instances which are configured with public IP.

Configuring an Azure Machine Learning compute instance with a public IP exposes it to significant security risks, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. This setup increases the likelihood of data breaches, where sensitive information and intellectual property could be accessed by unauthorized individuals, leading to potential data leakage and loss.

As a best practice, it is recommended not to configure Azure Machine Learning instances with public IP.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-machine-learning-compute' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded AND properties.properties.connectivityEndpoints.publicIpAddress exists AND properties.properties.connectivityEndpoints.publicIpAddress does not equal ignore case "null"

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146154

|This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions that have overly permissive network ingress settings. This includes both Cloud Functions v1 and Cloud Functions v2.

Ingress settings control whether resources outside of your Google Cloud project or VPC Service Controls perimeter can invoke a function.  With overly permissive ingress setting, all inbound requests to invoke function are allowed, both from the public and from resources within the same project. Restrictive network ingress settings for cloud functions in GCP minimize the risk of unauthorized access and attacks by limiting inbound traffic to trusted sources. This approach enhances security, prevents malicious activities, and ensures only legitimate traffic reaches your applications.

It is recommended to restrict the public traffic and allow traffic from VPC networks in the same project or traffic through the Cloud Load Balancer.

*Policy Severity—* Low
