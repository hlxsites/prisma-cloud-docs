|*AI Assisted Queries*

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.8.1] 

//RLP-146585, - To Do, JJ to share the doc link

|Enhancements to Prisma Cloud's query launcher allow you to use https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/search-and-investigate/launch-your-query[AI assisted queries] to retrieve saved searches from your current tenant. Going beyond keyword matching, AI powered semantic searches provide ease of use when launching investigations in Prisma Cloud. For instance, typing “public facing” as a query, returns results with “reachable from untrusted internet sources” as well, because the saved search matches the meaning of the query "public facing". AI assisted search can be toggled on and off as needed. Use the feedback buttons as shown in the image below to provide your feedback on this feature.

|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*AWS FSx for OpenZFS file systems not configured to copy tags to backups or volumes*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146695

|This policy identifies the AWS FSx for OpenZFS file system is configured to copy tags to backups or volumes.

AWS FSx for OpenZFS is a managed service for deploying and scaling OpenZFS file systems on AWS. Tags make resource identification and management easier, ensuring consistent security policies across file systems. Without copying tags to backups and volumes in AWS FSx for OpenZFS, enforcing consistent access control and tracking sensitive data in these resources becomes challenging.

It is recommended to configure an FSx for the OpenZFS file system to copy tags to backups and volumes.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-fsx-file-system' AND json.rule = FileSystemType equals "OPENZFS" and Lifecycle equals "AVAILABLE" and (OpenZFSConfiguration.CopyTagsToBackups is false or OpenZFSConfiguration.CopyTagsToVolumes is false )
----

|*AWS Private CA root certificate authority is enabled*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146681

|This policy identifies enabled AWS Private CA root certificate authorities.

AWS Private CA enables creating a root CA to issue private certificates for securing internal resources like servers, applications, users, devices, and containers. The root CA should be disabled for daily tasks to minimize risk, as it should only issue certificates for intermediate CAs, allowing it to remain secure while intermediate CAs handle the issuance of end-entity certificates.

It is recommended to disable the AWS Private CA root certificate authority to secure.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-acm-pca-certificate-authority' AND json.rule = Type equal ignore case ROOT and Status equal ignore case active
----

|*AWS EC2 instance is assigned with public IP*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146630

|This policy identifies the AWS EC2 instance having a public IP address assigned.

AWS EC2 instances with public IPs are virtual servers hosted in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud that can be accessed over the internet. Public IPs increase an EC2 instance's attack surface, necessitating robust security configurations to prevent unauthorized access and attacks.

It is recommended to use private IPv4 addresses for communication between EC2 instances and disassociate the public IP address from an instance or disable auto-assign public IP addresses in the subnet.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-instances' AND json.rule = networkInterfaces[*].association.publicIp exists
----

|*AWS Secrets Manager secret not configured to rotate within 90 days*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146436

|This policy identifies the AWS Secrets Manager secret is not configured to automatically rotate the secret within 90 days.

Rotating secrets minimizes the risk of compromised credentials and reduces exposure to potential threats. Failing to rotate secrets increases the risk of security breaches and prolonged exposure to threats.

It is recommended to configure automatic rotation in AWS Secrets Manager to replace long-term secrets with short-term ones, reducing the risk of compromise.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-secretsmanager-describe-secret' AND json.rule = rotationEnabled is true and owningService is not member of (appflow, databrew, datasync, directconnect, events, opsworks-cm, rds, sqlworkbench) and rotationRules.automaticallyAfterDays exists and rotationRules.automaticallyAfterDays greater than 90
----

|*AWS RDS instance with network path from the untrust internet source*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-145572

|This policy identifies AWS RDS instances with network path from untrusted internet source.

AWS RDS is AWS managed service for running relational databases in the cloud. Allowing an AWS RDS instance to be reachable from any untrusted internet source increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches due to expanded attack surface.

It is recommended to restrict traffic from untrusted IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities for the RDS Database instances.

NOTE: Prisma Cloud Trusted IP List allows administrators to specify a list of IP addresses that are considered trusted or safe.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Network Config

----
config from network where source.network = UNTRUST_INTERNET and dest.resource.type = 'PaaS' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' and dest.paas.service.type = 'AWS RDS' 
----

|*AWS Redshift cluster with network path from the untrust internet source*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-145570

|This policy identifies the AWS Redshift clusters with network path from the untrusted internet source.

Redshift clusters are AWS cloud-based data warehouses designed for data analysis and querying of large datasets. Allowing an AWS Redshift cluster to be reachable from any untrusted internet source increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches due to expanded attack surface.

It is recommended to restrict traffic from untrusted IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities for the Redshift clusters.

NOTE: Prisma Cloud Trusted IP List allows administrators to specify a list of IP addresses that are considered trusted or safe.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Network Config

----
config from network where source.network = UNTRUST_INTERNET and dest.resource.type = 'PaaS' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' and dest.paas.service.type = 'AWS Redshift'
----

|*Azure Microsoft Entra ID users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf not set to verified publishers*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146433

|This policy identifies instances in the Microsoft Entra ID configuration where users in your Azure Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) can consent to applications accessing company data on their behalf, even if the applications are not from verified publishers.

Allowing unverified applications to access company data increases the likelihood of data breaches and unauthorized access, which could lead to the exposure of confidential information. Using unverified applications can lead to non-compliance with data protection regulations and undermine trust in the organization's data handling practices.

As a best practice, it is recommended to configure the user consent settings to restrict access only to applications from verified publishers.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = defaultUserRolePermissions.permissionGrantPoliciesAssigned[*] does not contain "ManagePermissionGrantsForSelf.microsoft-user-default-low"
----

|*Azure Machine Learning compute instance not running latest OS Image Version*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146432

|This policy identifies Azure Machine Learning compute instances not running on the latest available image version.

Running compute instances on outdated image versions increases security risks. Without the latest security patches and updates, these instances are more vulnerable to attacks, which can compromise machine learning models and data.

As a best practice, it is recommended to recreate or update Azure Machine Learning compute instances to the latest image version, ensuring they have the most recent security patches and updates.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-machine-learning-compute' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case "Succeeded" and properties.properties.state equal ignore case "Running" and properties.properties.osImageMetadata.isLatestOsImageVersion is false
----

|*Azure Network Watcher not enabled*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146431

|This policy identifies Azure subscription regions where Network Watcher is not enabled. 

Azure Network Watcher provides tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for resources in an Azure virtual network. Without Network Watcher enabled, you lose critical capabilities to monitor and diagnose network issues, making it difficult to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks, network security rules, and connectivity issues.

As a best practice, it is recommended to enable Azure Network Watcher for your region to leverage its monitoring and diagnostic capabilities.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-watcher-list' AND json.rule = provisioningState equals Succeeded as X; count(X) less than 1
----

|*Azure SQL server public network access setting is enabled*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-39590

|This policy identifies Azure SQL servers which have public network access setting enabled. 

Publicly accessible SQL servers are vulnerable to external threats with risk of unauthorized access or may remotely exploit any vulnerabilities.

It is recommended to configure the SQL servers with IP-based strict server-level firewall rules or virtual-network rules or private endpoints so that servers are accessible only to restricted entities.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = ['sqlServer'].['properties.state'] equal ignore case Ready and ['sqlServer'].['properties.publicNetworkAccess'] equal ignore case Enabled and ['sqlServer'].['properties.privateEndpointConnections'] is empty and firewallRules[*] is empty
----

|*Azure PostgreSQL flexible server secure transport parameter is disabled*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-39432

|This policy identifies PostgreSQL flexible servers for which secure transport (SSL connectivity) parameter is disabled. 

Secure transport (SSL connectivity) helps to provide a new layer of security, by connecting server to client applications using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Enforcing SSL connections between server and client applications helps protect against ‘man in the middle’ attacks by encrypting the data stream between the server and application.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to enable secure transport parameter for Azure PostgreSQL flexible server.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-postgresql-flexible-server' AND json.rule = properties.state equal ignore case Ready and require_secure_transport.value does not equal ignore case on
----

|*Azure SQL server using insecure TLS version*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-36846

|This policy identifies Azure SQL servers which use insecure TLS version. 

Enforcing TLS connections between database server and client applications helps protect against 'man in the middle' attacks by encrypting the data stream between the server and application. 

As a security best practice, it is recommended to use the latest TLS version for Azure SQL server.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = ['sqlServer'].['properties.state'] equal ignore case "Ready" and (['sqlServer'].['properties.minimalTlsVersion'] equal ignore case "None" or ['sqlServer'].['properties.minimalTlsVersion'] equals "1.0" or ['sqlServer'].['properties.minimalTlsVersion'] equals "1.1")
----

|*GCP Cloud Function not enabled with VPC connector for network egress*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146158

|This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions that are not enabled with a VPC connector for network egress. This includes both Cloud Functions v1 and Cloud Functions v2.

Using a VPC connector for network egress in GCP Cloud Functions is crucial to prevent security risks such as data interception and unauthorized access. This practice strengthens security by allowing safe communication with private resources, enhancing traffic monitoring, reducing the risk of data leaks, and ensuring compliance with security policies.

It is recommended to configure GCP Cloud Functions with a VPC connector.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-cloud-function-v2' AND json.rule = state equals ACTIVE and serviceConfig.vpcConnector does not exist
----

|*GCP Cloud Function with overly permissive network ingress settings*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146154

|This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions that have overly permissive network ingress settings. This includes both Cloud Functions v1 and Cloud Functions v2.

Ingress settings control whether resources outside of your Google Cloud project or VPC Service Controls perimeter can invoke a function.  With overly permissive ingress setting, all inbound requests to invoke function are allowed, both from the public and from resources within the same project. Restrictive network ingress settings for cloud functions in GCP minimize the risk of unauthorized access and attacks by limiting inbound traffic to trusted sources. This approach enhances security, prevents malicious activities, and ensures only legitimate traffic reaches your applications.

It is recommended to restrict the public traffic and allow traffic from VPC networks in the same project or traffic through the Cloud Load Balancer.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-cloud-function-v2' AND json.rule = state equals ACTIVE and serviceConfig.ingressSettings equals ALLOW_ALL
----

|*GCP Cloud Function v1 is using unsecured HTTP trigger*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146140

|This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions v1 that are using unsecured HTTP trigger.

Using HTTP triggers for cloud functions poses significant security risks, including vulnerability to interception, tampering, and various attacks like man-in-the-middle. Conversely, HTTPS triggers provide encrypted communication, safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring confidentiality. HTTPS also supports authentication mechanisms, enhancing overall security and trust.

It is recommended to enable 'Require HTTPS' for HTTP triggers for all cloud functions v1.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-cloud-function-v2' AND json.rule = environment equals GEN_1 and serviceConfig.securityLevel does not equal SECURE_ALWAYS
----

|*GCP Cloud Function is publicly accessible by allUsers or allAuthenticatedUsers*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146140

|This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions that are publicly accessible by allUsers or allAuthenticatedUsers.

Granting permissions to 'allusers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' on any resource in GCP makes the resource public. Public access over cloud functions can lead to unauthorized invocations of the function or leakage of sensitive information such as the function's source code. 

Following the least privileged access policy, it is recommended to grant access restrictively and avoid granting permissions to allUsers or allAuthenticatedUsers unless absolutely needed.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-cloud-function-v2' AND json.rule = state equals ACTIVE and iamPolicy.bindings[?any(members[*] is member of ("allAuthenticatedUsers","allUsers"))] exists
----

|*GCP Cloud Function is granted a basic role*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-145853

|This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions that are granted a basic role. This includes both Cloud Functions v1 and Cloud Functions v2.

Basic roles are highly permissive roles that existed before the introduction of IAM and grant wide access over project to the grantee. The use of basic roles for granting permissions increases the blast radius and could help to escalate privilege further in case the Cloud Function is compromised.

Following the principle of least privilege, it is recommended to avoid the use of basic roles.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-projects-get-iam-user' AND json.rule = roles[*] contains "roles/viewer" or roles[*] contains "roles/editor" or roles[*] contains "roles/owner" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-cloud-function-v2' as Y; filter '$.Y.serviceConfig.serviceAccountEmail equals $.X.user'; show Y;
----

|*OCI Object Storage Bucket write level logging is disabled*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-61035

|This policy identifies Object Storage buckets that have write-level logging disabled.

Enabling write-level logging for Object Storage provides more visibility into changes to objects in your buckets. Without write-level logging, there is no record of changes made to the bucket. This lack of visibility can lead to undetected data breaches, unauthorized changes, and compliance violations.

As a best practice, it is recommended to enable write-level logging on Object Storage buckets.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'oci-object-storage-bucket' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'oci-logging-logs' as Y; filter 'not ($.X.name contains $.Y.configuration.source.resource and $.Y.configuration.source.service contains objectstorage and $.Y.configuration.source.category contains write and $.Y.lifecycleState equal ignore case ACTIVE )'; show X;
----

|*User with Administrative Permissions Has Active Access Keys Which Are Unused Over 90 Days*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146497

|Identifies user accounts with administrative permissions for which active access keys exist and have not been used in at least 90 days. Access keys are long-term credentials which allow AWS IAM users programmatic access to resources. When the user in question possesses administrative permissions, and their access keys are active but not in use, they can potentially be found by an adversary, granting them administrative permissions.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* IAM

*Policy Subtype—* Permissions

----
config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' AND action.access.isAdministrative = true AND source.cloud.accesskey.lastused.days > 90 AND source.cloud.accesskey.activekeys > 0
----

|*Cloud Service account with high privileges is inactive for 90 days and is assigned to a resource*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146497

|Identifies cloud service accounts in Azure, AWS and GCP which have administrative permissions that have not been used in the last 90 days and are attached to a resource. 

As opposed to user accounts, service accounts are predictable. Therefore, if a service account has administrative permissions which it has not used in the past 90 days, we can confidently say the resource it is attached to does not require them, and remove the permissions, decreasing the blast radius in case of a compromise of the service account.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* IAM

*Policy Subtype—* Permissions

----
config from iam where grantedby.cloud.entity.type IN ( 'role', 'serviceaccount', 'service principal', 'user assigned', 'system assigned' ) AND action.access.isAdministrative = true AND grantedby.cloud.entity.lastlogin.days > 90 AND source.cloud.resource.type in ( 'instance', 'function', 'oidc-provider', 'environment', 'task-definition', 'WebIdentity', 'virtualMachines', 'sites', 'App Registration', 'service', 'workflows', 'virtualMachineScaleSets/virtualMachines', 'instances', 'applications', 'services', 'functions', 'serviceAccounts')
----

|*User account with high privileges and MFA disabled*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146497

|Identifies user accounts with administrative permissions for which Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enabled. 

Sensitive accounts such as those with administrative permissions are considered high value to attackers and tend to be targeted. 

As such, these accounts, when not safeguarded by an additional authentication factor, have a higher chance of successful compromise, which would result in the adversary gaining administrative permissions within your ogranization.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* IAM

*Policy Subtype—* Permissions

----
config from iam where action.access.isAdministrative = true AND source.cloud.resource.type = 'user' AND source.mfaenabled = False
----

|*Third-Party Service Account with High Privileges at the Folder or Organization Level*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146497

|Identifies instances of third-party vendor owned service accounts which are granted high privileges and may allow administrative access to your cloud environment. 

This increases the attack surface, as in case of a compromise of the vendor's environment, an attacker would gain elevated access to your account by abusing the service account permissions.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* IAM

*Policy Subtype—* Permissions

----
config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'GCP' AND grantedby.cloud.entity.type = 'serviceaccount' AND action.access.isAdministrative = true AND source.cloud.account.isvendor = true AND grantedby.level.type IN ( 'GCP Organization', 'GCP Folder' )
----


|*Service Account with Cross Cloud Administrative Access*

tt:[24.8.1]
//RLP-146497

|Identifies service accounts with permissions to assume an administrative role in another account hosted in a different cloud vendor environment. 

Administrative permissions can result in the compromising of the security posture of your organization.

As the service account resides in a separate cloud vendor's environment, a compromise of the source account could lead to lateral movement exposing the second account and enlarging the blast radius across cloud provider environments.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* IAM

|*GCP GKE unsupported Master node version*
//RLP-146735

tt:[24.8.1]

|*Changes—* The policy description and RQL are updated to narrow down resources based on currently supported GKE versions and remove false positives.

*Current Policy Description—* Ensure your GKE Master node version is supported. This policy checks your GKE master node version and generates an alert if the version running is unsupported.

*Updated Policy Description—* This policy identifies the GKE master node version and generates an alert if the version running is unsupported.

Using an unsupported version of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) can lead to several potential issues and risks, such as security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues, performance and stability problems, and compliance concerns. To mitigate these risks, it's crucial to regularly update the GKE clusters to supported versions recommended by Google Cloud.

As a security best practice, it is always recommended to use the latest version of GKE.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----

//RLP-146951

tt:[24.8.1]

|*Changes—* The policy name, description, and recommendation metadata are revised as follows:

*Current Policy Name—* AWS EC2 instance that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0)

*Updated Policy Name—* AWS EC2 instance with network path from the internet (0.0.0.0/0)

*Current Policy Description—* This policy identifies AWS EC2 instances that are internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0). EC2 instances with unrestricted access to the internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorised access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

*Updated Policy Description—* This policy identifies AWS EC2 instances with network path from the internet (0.0.0.0/0).

AWS EC2 instances with network path from the internet increases the risk of unauthorized access, cyber attacks, and data breaches, as it may provide a larger attack surface for malicious actors. Such instances are especially prone to brute force or vulnerability exploits.

As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit the access from known hosts, services, or specific entities.
