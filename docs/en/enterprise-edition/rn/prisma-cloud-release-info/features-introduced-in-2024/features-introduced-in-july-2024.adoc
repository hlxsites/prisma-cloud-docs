|*Feature*
|*Description*


|*Identify Cloud Workload Identities*

//IVG-15366
tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.7.3]

|Enhancements to Prisma Cloud's CIEM capabilities enable you to extract relevant information about GCP service accounts with access to your AWS environment. Configure IAM roles to proactively defend against cross-cloud lateral threat vectors. Use the RQL query below to investigate trust policies, to securely handle identities and permissions across your multicloud environments. 

* `config from IAM where source.cloud.type = GCP and dest.cloud.type = AWS and dest.cloud.resource.access.isadministrative = True`


|*Support for Last Access Detection*

//IVG-15363/IVG-15364/IVG-15365
tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.7.3]

|Prisma Cloud's IAM functionality now includes the ability to to detect inactive cloud service accounts, by querying the days passed since the last usage of the cloud service account. Available for AWS and Azure, you can use the RQL clause below to find last login information for AWS roles and Azure service principals.

* `grantedby.cloud.entity.lastlogin`

*Attribute Type*: Number (Days since the last login/activity)

*Values*: - <, >, <=, >=, =, =!

|*Source Vendor RQL Support for AWS and GCP*

//IVG-14953
tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.7.3]

|RQL enhancements now provide greater visibility into validated vendor access including access type and usage in AWS and GCP environments. The following attribute is supported in both AWS and GCP:

* `source.cloud.account.isvendor`

|*RQL Support for MFA*

//RLP-146592
tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.7.3]

|Protect your cloud environment from infiltration by identifying users that do not use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The Cloud Identity and Exposure Management (CIEM) enhancements allow you to identify users without MFA enabled. Use the new RQL query `source.MFAenabled` to create policies such as `user with high privileges and MFA disabled` with the appropriate severities. The query will return True/False values (whether MFA is active/inactive).


|*Enhanced CVE Runtime Vulnerability Detection*

//BCE-36529
tt:[Secure the Source]

tt:[24.7.3]

|Mitigate vulnerabilities at their source, and proactively prevent them from reaching runtime environments, with Prisma Cloud's enhanced CVE vulnerability detection. Leverage the *Vulnerability Risk Factors* filter on the *Home > Application Security > Projects* page to identify vulnerabilities based on *Package in Runtime*, *Repository in Runtime*, and *Manifest in Runtime* filters. These https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/application-security/risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/software-composition-analysis/software-composition-analysis[filters] allow you to hone in on the vulnerabilities at their source and prevent runtime access.   

|*Support for .NET Central Package Management*

//BCE-33821
tt:[Secure the Source]

tt:[24.7.3]

|Prisma Cloud's Application Security enhancements now offers support for additional package managers that help you manage common dependencies for multiple projects in a single location. Additional support for NuGet’s Central Package Management lets you store your varied packaged projects in the `Directory.Packages.props` file. Learn more about this https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/application-security/supported-technologies[enhancement] to Software Composition Analysis (SCA) capabilities.


|*Identify Third-Party AI Libraries*

//BCE-36651
tt:[Secure the Source]

tt:[24.7.3]

|Identify third-party AI Libraries with ease with Prisma Cloud's enhanced https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/application-security/visibility/sbom/sbom[Software Bill of Material] (SBOM) enhancements. Navigate to *Home > Application Security > Visibility > SBOM* to detect Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) functionality incorporated into your codebase through third-party libraries. Use this information to build a comprehensive inventory of the machine learning packages, to help you effectively mitigate risks and make informed security decisions.


|*Improve Package Management with Application Graph*

//BCE-36940
tt:[Secure the Source]

tt:[24.7.3]

|The https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/application-security/visibility/repositories#app-graph[Application Graph] now visualizes all packages in your repository, including the number of package files, and direct and indirect dependencies. This visual representation helps you identify potential dependency conflicts and manage package relationships effectively. Use the vulnerable packages filter to quickly find packages that include vulnerabilities.


|*Effectively Allocate Security Resources with the Repository Importance Score*

//BCE-33801
tt:[Secure the Source]

tt:[24.7.3]

|Enhancements to the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/application-security/visibility/repositories#repo-importance-score[Repository Importance Score] allow you to prioritize security efforts across multiple code repositories, by quantifying the significance of each repository. Leverage this data-driven scoring system, to categorize important repositories, and prioritize fixing issues in the most critical repositories first. You can also customize this score to accommodate your organization’s specific security priorities, and secure your business-critical assets.


// |*Support for Azure Container Registry and VM image scanning*
// //CWP-57626

// tt:[Secure the Runtime]

// tt:[32.07.123]

// |Prisma Cloud now supports scanning Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Virtual Machine (VM) images for Azure cloud accounts that are onboarded directly through the platform.

|*A new registry scan status*
//CWP-60158

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[32.07.123]

|A new status, *Partially Completed*, has been added to the scan statuses for registry scans. This status is assigned when at least one image has been successfully scanned in the registry.

The Partially Completed status appears as follows during the registry scan:

image::partially-completed.png[width=50] 

It also displays the number of images that have been scanned successfully.


|*Support for New Regions on OCI*

//RLP-142166
tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.7.2]

|Prisma Cloud now ingests data for resources deployed in Chicago, Madrid, Paris, Queretaro https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/connect/connect-cloud-accounts/cloud-service-provider-regions-on-prisma-cloud#idd0c65f48-29eb-40b4-a799-0c404671e501[cloud regions] on OCI.

To review the list of supported regions, select *Inventory > Assets*, and choose *Cloud Region* filter.

|tt:[Update] 
*Vulnerabilities Dashboard*
//PCUI-6499

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[*24.7.1*]


|The *Vulnerabilities* dashboard now provides 3 new widgets:

* *Overview*—Displays the number of *Unique CVEs*, total number of *Vulnerabilities*, and *Vulnerabilities Remediated*.

* *Vulnerabilities Funnel*—Displays the number of vulnerabilities, instead of unique CVEs and separates risks introduced by CVEs from the environmental ones.

* *Most Important Vulnerabilities*—Displays the top vulnerabilities and provides a direct link of assets at risk.

image::vulnerabilities-dashboard-1.png[]

You can also *CVE Preview Card*, which highlights the most important information about a CVE, without the need to click on it and open the sidecar.

image::cve-preview-card.png[]

|tt:[Update]
*CSV Bulk Download in Table View*
//RLP-130840

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[*24.7.1*] 

|Previously, you would have to download the CSV file per CVE, which was time consuming and tedious. Now, in the table view, you can select *Download > Download all CVE data* in a single CSV file. The CSV file is limited to 10K records. 

image::csv-bulk-download-table.png[]

|tt:[Update] 
*Vulnerability Results in Table View*

[#intelligence-stream-updates]
=== Intelligence Stream Updates

[cols="25%a,75%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

//CWP-57783
|*Severity Mapping Update for Intelligence Stream*

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[32.07.123]

|The severity values for the Intelligence stream are now mapped into 2 predefined values: “ High” and “Medium”.

Note: The severity values are already normalized to create rules. The current change is only specific to the severity reporting name change.

The following list defines the new vendor severity mapping:

---

* *Current Severity*: Important
* *New Severity*: High
* *Vendors*: Amazon, Oracle, RedHat, Rocky, Suse, Ubuntu

---

* *Current Severity*: Moderate
* *New Severity*: Medium
* *Vendors*: Oracle, RedHat, Rocky, Suse, Windows

---

* *Current Severity*: End-of-life
* *New Severity*: Low, Medium, High, or Critical based on NVD
* *Vendors*: Debian

*Note*: End-of-life will be set in the vulnerability status.

---
Note: The previous “unimportant”, “unassigned”, “untriaged”, “negligible” and “not yet assigned” severity mapping behaviour remains unchanged.

All the other unrecognized severity values from the different feeds will be assigned according to the NVD severity.

For more information, see https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/runtime-security/vulnerability-management/cvss-scoring#mappings[CVSS Scoring].

//CWP-60870
|*End of support for Debian 10 (Buster)*

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[32.07.123]

|Debian 10 (Buster) reached end-of-life on June 30, 2024. Starting from July 2024, the Debian Long Term Support (LTS) team has stopped providing security information for Debian 10.

Consequently, vulnerabilities related to Debian 10 (Buster) were removed from the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream.

*Impact*: Starting from this version, customers using Debian Buster (LTS or ELTS) will no longer see vulnerability data related to this version.

//RLP-143514

|This policy identifies DMS replication tasks where logging is either not enabled or set below the minimum severity level, such as LOGGER_SEVERITY_DEFAULT, for SOURCE_CAPTURE and SOURCE_UNLOAD. 

Logging is indispensable in DMS replication for various purposes, including monitoring, troubleshooting, auditing, performance analysis, error detection, recovery, and historical reporting. SOURCE_CAPTURE captures ongoing replication or CDC data from the source database, while SOURCE_UNLOAD unloads data during full load. Logging these tasks is crucial for ensuring data integrity, compliance, and accountability during migration.

It is recommended to enable logging for AWS DMS replication tasks and set a minimal logging level of DEFAULT for SOURCE_CAPTURE and SOURCE_UNLOAD to ensure that essential messages are logged, facilitating effective monitoring, troubleshooting, and compliance efforts.

tt:[*24.7.1*]
//RLP-143510

|This policy identifies the DMS replication tasks that are logging isn't enabled or the minimum severity level is less than LOGGER_SEVERITY_DEFAULT for TARGET_APPLY and TARGET_LOAD.

Amazon DMS Logging is crucial in DMS replication for monitoring, troubleshooting, auditing, performance analysis, error detection, recovery, and historical reporting. TARGET_APPLY and TARGET_LOAD must be logged because they manage to apply data and DDL changes, as well as loading data into the target database, crucial for maintaining data integrity during migration. The absence of logging for TARGET_APPLY and TARGET_LOAD components hampers monitoring, compliance, auditing, troubleshooting, and accountability efforts during migration.

It is recommended to enable logging for AWS DMS replication tasks and set a minimal logging level of DEFAULT for TARGET_APPLY and TARGET_LOAD to ensure that informational messages, warnings, and error messages are written to the logs.

|*AWS Log metric filter and alarm does not exist for management console sign-in without MFA*

tt:[*24.7.1*]
//RLP-142352

|This policy identifies the AWS regions that do not have a log metric filter and alarm for management console sign-in without MFA.

A log metric filter in AWS CloudWatch scans log data for specific patterns and generates metrics based on those patterns. Unauthorized access attempts may go undetected without a log metric filter and alarm for console sign-ins without MFA. This increases the risk of account compromise and potential data breaches due to inadequate security monitoring.

It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for management console sign-in without MFA to increase visibility into accounts that are not protected by MFA.

NOTE: This policy will trigger an alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi-trail is enabled, Logs all management events in your account, and is not set with a specific log metric filter and alarm.

|*Azure Logic App does not utilize HTTP 2.0 version*

tt:[*24.7.1*]
//RLP-143246

|This policy identifies Azure Logic apps that are not utilizing HTTP 2.0 version.

Azure Logic app using HTTP 1.0 for its connection is considered as not secure as HTTP 2.0 version has additional performance improvements on the head-of-line blocking problem of old HTTP version, header compression, and prioritisation of requests. HTTP 2.0 no longer supports HTTP 1.1's chunked transfer encoding mechanism, as it provides its own, more efficient, mechanisms for data streaming.

As a security best practice,  it is recommended to configure HTTP 2.0 version for Logic apps connections.

tt:[*24.7.1*]
//RLP-143244

|This policy identifies Azure Logic apps that are using insecure TLS version.

Azure Logic apps configured to use insecure TLS versions are at risk as they may be vulnerable to security threats due to the known vulnerabilities, weaker encryption methods, and support for compromised hash functions. Logic apps using TLS 1.2 or higher will secure communication and protect against potential cyber attacks.

As a security best practice,  it is recommended to configure Logic apps with TLS 1.2 or higher to ensure secure communication.

----

|*Azure Logic app is not configured with managed identity*

tt:[*24.7.1*]
//RLP-143243

|This policy identifies Azure Logic apps that are not configured with managed identity.

Managed identity can be used to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. Including credentials in code heightens the risk in the event of a security breach and increases the threat surface in case of exploitation and also managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials. 

As a security best practice, it is recommended to set up managed identity rather than embedding credentials within the code.

*Policy Severity—* Low

|*Azure Logic app configured with public network access*

tt:[*24.7.1*]
//RLP-143241

|This policy identifies Azure Logic apps that are configured with public network access. 

Exposing Logic Apps directly to the public internet increases the attack surface, making them more susceptible to unauthorized access, security threats, and potential breaches. By limiting Logic Apps to private network access, they are securely managed and less prone to external vulnerabilities.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to configure private network access or restrict the public exposure only to the required entities instead of wide ranges.

|*OCI Load balancer listener allows connection requests over HTTP*

tt:[*24.7.1*]
//RLP-53215

|This policy identifies Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Load Balancer listeners that accept connection requests over HTTP instead of HTTPS or HTTP/2 or TCP protocols.

Accepting connections over HTTP can expose data to potential interception and unauthorized access, as HTTP traffic is transmitted in plaintext. OCI Load Balancer allow all traffic to be submitted over HTTPS or HTTP/2 or TCP, ensuring all communications are encrypted. These protocols provide encrypted communication channels, safeguarding sensitive information from eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to configure the listeners to accept connections through HTTPS, HTTP/2, or TCP, thereby enhancing the protection of data in-transit.

//RLP-145373

|*Changes—* This policy descrption and recommendation steps will be updated to better match the policy.

*Severity—* High

*Cloud—* AWS

*Updated Description—*
	
Identifies roles which have administrative permissions and can be assumed by an identity in an "external account". An external account is one not known to Prisma cloud as part of your organization and not that of a known vendor. This policy relies on the default account group, therefore if the group is changed this policy will not reflect the environment entirely. The default account group is created upon onboarding to Prisma Cloud, and contains all instance-related accounts known to Prisma Cloud. External accounts are considered as such if Prisma are unaware of them in the context of your environment (i.e not part of the onboarded accounts). As we do not have visibility or control over the external entity, giving it the ability to gain administartive permissions in the environment is considered high risk.

*Recommendation Steps—*

How to investigate?

1. In the Prisma Cloud Console, select 'Investigate'
2. Paste the following query into the investigation prompt, replacing the placeholder with the account ID you wish to verify: config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' AND source.cloud.account='<account-id>' and dest.cloud.account='<account-id>'

3a. If results are returned, this is an indicator that Prisma is scanning the account, and as such is aware of it
If this is the case, select 'settings' and then 'Account Groups'
Search for the default account group, under 'Actions' select 'Edit'. Search for the account in question and add it

3b. If no results are returned, this means Prisma has no knowledge of the account in question (i.e it is not onboarded and in the eyes of Prisma, external)

In order to continue the investigation, using the AWS CLI, run 'aws organizations list-accounts', and you will recieve a list of all the accounts within the AWS organization
Repeat this process for every AWS organization you own. If the account in question does not appear, it can be concluded as external

In order to remove its access, use the following remediation steps:

Log in to your AWS account
Navigate to the affected role, and select the 'Trusted entities' tab.
Select 'Edit trust policy' and remove the entries allowing assumption from external sources.
Ensure the remaining entries are required, and save your changes.

Utilizing the Default Role functionality and AWS Redshift's inherent features, such as the 'COPY' command, the attacker able to move laterally in the environment is positioned to gain access to almost all sensitive resources in the environment.

|*Azure Lateral Movement via VM Command Execution Leveraging Managed Identity*

|Using this role allows running commands on any virtual machine in the subscription, with 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/runCommand/action' an adversary can steal credentials connected to the VM and preform lateral movments from the accessed VM.

|Using this permission allows code execution on any virtual machine in the subscription, with 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/runCommand/action' an adversary can use the assigned managed-identity connected to the VMs and move laterally between Vnets, environments and resources from the accessed VM.

|*Azure Lateral Movement Through SSH Key Replacement and Managed Identity Exploitation on VM*

|Using this role allows creating and changing virtual machines in the subscription, with 'Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/write' and 'Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/extensions/write' an adversary can update SSH keys for a given VM in the subscription and hijack the resource. 

|Using this role allows creating and changing virtual machines in the subscription, with 'Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/write' and 'Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/extensions/write' an adversary can update SSH keys for a given VM in the subscription and hijack the resource. In this way, they can connect any VM in the subscription, use the assigned managed-identity connected to them and move laterally between Vnets, environments and resources from the accessed VM.

|*GCP Lateral Access Expansion by Making Cloud Run Publicly Executable*

|Entity can update cloud run instance code and public execution permissions, potentially with high permissions.

|Cloud Run compute instances often attached with a service account. Adversaries with the above permissions can update cloud run instance code and public execution permissions, potentially use the service account attached to the run instance, which gives them the ability to move laterally between different resources in the environment, on behalf of the cloud run.

|*GCP Project-Wide Lateral Movement via SSH Key Modification for VMs*

|Entity can update VM instance metadata for all project VMs and modify SSH keys for virtual machines inside the project allowing a lateral movement and hijacking virtual machines and using their identity.

|Entities with permissions to update VM instance metadata for all project VMs and modify their SSH keys can hijack  any VM in the project, use the assigned service account to them and move laterally between Vnets, environments and resources from the accessed VM.

|*GCP Cloud Run Job Public Execution via Default Compute SA Modification*

|Entity can update cloud run job code and public execution permissions, potentially with high permissions.

|Entities with run.jobs.setIamPolicy permission can modify IAM policies to grant rights (e.g. run.jobs.create, run.jobs.run ) over Cloud Jobs, enabling the execution of malicious jobs,that can lead to privilege escalation and lateral movement within cloud environments.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*


|*Azure Onboarding Terraform Permission Deprecations*
//RLP-126774/RLP-146960

tt:[*24.7.3*]

|The following Azure permissions have been deprecated by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP), as a result they are no longer required to run the Prisma Cloud Azure Onboarding Terraform template.

* Microsoft.Media/mediaservices/read
* Microsoft.TimeSeriesInsights/environments/read
* Microsoft.DataCatalog/catalogs/read


|*Enhancement to Photon OS and Amazon Linux OS Feeds*
//CWP-59772
tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[32.07.123]

|Prisma Cloud now parses Photon OS and Amazon Linux OS feeds using CVE IDs as the primary vulnerability identifier instead of advisory IDs. This change enhances Prisma Cloud’s ability to correlate third-party data, and use vendor-provided information, including backports, severity assessments, and vulnerability scores.

|*Google Cloud Source Repositories*

tt:[*24.7.2*]
//RLP-144967

|The `sourcerepo.googleapis.com` service has been deprecated by GCP CSP. As a result, the `sourcerepo.googleapis.com` service has been removed from Terraform.

*Impact—* Due to this change, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest metadata from the  `gcloud-cloud-source-repository` API for accounts newly onboarded after June 6th, 2024. However, for accounts onboarded before this date, the API will continue to be supported. The permissions check for `source.repos.list` and `source.repos.getIamPolicy` will no longer be conducted for these already onboarded accounts.

|*Tag-based Resource Lists*

tt:[*24.7.2*]
//RLP-140177

|The following limits are enforced for Tag-based Resource Lists:

* Tag-based Resource Lists are limited to 10 key-value pairs
* Up to 5 Tag-based Resource Lists may be associated with a Role
* Tag-based Resource List Tag key and value is limited to 256 characters each

*Impact—* These changes will affect Tag-based Resource Lists and Roles after the release. Existing configurations will not be affected.

//Commenting out per feedback from AO 5/24 - check for 24.7.1 inclusion

|*Tag-based Resource List Support for Asset Explorer*

tt:[*24.7.2*]
//RLP-140151

|Tag-based Resource Lists RBAC is enforced for *Asset Explorer*— `uai/v1/asset` endpoint.

*Impact—* If user assigned role is non system admin and has assigned resource list, user will be able to fetch asset having assigned tag. No impact for user without any assigned resource list.

|*Change to Compliance Trendline*

tt:[*24.7.2*]

//*Change to Compliance Trendline and Deprecation of Compliance Filters*
//RLP-144230, RLP-144161, RLP-144168
//*Compliance Trendline Available Only up to Past One Year*

|The Compliance or Asset Inventory trendline will display data only from the past one year to provide better performance. Prisma Cloud will not retain the snapshots of data older than one year.

//The Compliance-related filters (Compliance Requirement, Compliance Standard, and Compliance Section) will not be available on *Asset Inventory* (Inventory > Assets).

//Starting with the 24.7.2 release, you will be able to access compliance trendline data only of the past 1 year. This change is implemented to optimize system performance and reduce data storage requirements.



|*New Limits for Audit Logs API*

tt:[*24.7.1*]
//RLP-145079, RLP-142211

|To improve the user experience, a response size limit of 100K records is now implemented for the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/rl-audit-logs/[GET - /audit/redlock] Audit Logs endpoint.

*Impact—* Requests exceeding 100K records limit results in a *413 Payload Too Large* error with _X-Record-Count_ header, which indicates the number of records that were being requested.

|*API Rate Limits — Update User Role API*

tt:[*24.7.1*]
//RLP-141323

|To resolve a critical performance issue with the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/update-user-role/[Update User Role] API (PUT /user/role), a rate limit with the following parameters is now implemented:

`Limit=3, Burst=3` 

*Impact—* Requests exceeding these limits result in an *HTTP 429* Too Many Requests response.
