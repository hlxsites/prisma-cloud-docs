|*Feature*
|*Description*


|*View Saved Filters as Saved Views*

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[24.2.2]
//RLP-128172

|Saved Filters on Prisma Cloud are now available as *Saved Views* on the Alerts, Compliance, and Governance pages. Navigate to *Home > Alerts/Compliance/Governance > Overview* to find your filter combinations available as *Saved Views*. The following caveats apply:

* Views are no longer limited to a maximum of 20.
* Saved Views are enabled by default for the persona (Cloud/Runtime/Application Security) you created them in. If you use the Prisma Cloud switcher to try another persona, the view is disabled but you have the option to re-enable it.
* All users, except those who were added after the migration to Saved Views will have access to previously saved filter configurations.

You can also create new https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/alerts/saved-views[Saved Views] to store select filter combinations and table configurations for a customizable look at your security posture.

|*Policies*
|*Description*


|*Azure Batch Account configured with overly permissive network access*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-69482

|This policy identifies Batch Accounts configured with overly permissive network access. By default, Batch accounts are accessible from the all networks. With an Account access IP firewall, you can restrict it further to only a set of IPv4 addresses or IPv4 address ranges. With Private access Virtual Networks, the network traffic path is secured on both ends. It is recommended to configure the Batch account with an IP firewall or by Virtual Network, so that the Batch account is accessible only to restricted entities.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-batch-account' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and properties.networkProfile.accountAccess.defaultAction equal ignore case Allow and properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled
----


|*Azure Storage Account storing Machine Learning workspace high business impact data is publicly accessible*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-124737

|This policy identifies Azure Storage Accounts storing Machine Learning workspace high business impact data that are publicly accessible. Azure Storage account stores machine learning artifacts such as job logs. By default, this storage account is used when you upload data to the workspace. The attacker could exploit publicly accessible storage account to get machine learning workspace high business impact data logs and could breach in to the system by leveraging data exposed. It is recommended to restrict storage account access to only to the machine learning services as per business requirement.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-machine-learning-workspace' AND json.rule = 'properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and properties.hbiWorkspace is true and properties.storageAccount exists' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = 'totalPublicContainers > 0 and (properties.allowBlobPublicAccess is true or properties.allowBlobPublicAccess does not exist)' as Y; filter '$.X.properties.storageAccount contains $.Y.id'; show Y;
----


|*AWS account security contact information is not set*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-126209

|This policy identifies the AWS account which has not set security contact information. Providing dedicated contact information for security specific, AWS can directly communicate security advisories to the team responsible for handling security-related issues. Failure to specify security contact info in AWS risks missing critical advisories, leading to delayed incident response and increased vulnerability exposure. It is recommended to set security contact information to receive notifications.

*Policy Severity—* Information

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-account-management-alternate-contact' group by account as X; filter ' AlternateContactType is not member of ("SECURITY") ' ;
----


|*Azure Cognitive Services account configured with local authentication*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-126234

|This policy identifies Azure Cognitive Services accounts that are configured with local authentication methods instead of AD identity. Local authentication allows users to access the service using a local account and password, rather than an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account. Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Cognitive Services accounts require Active Directory identities exclusively for authentication. It is recommended to disable local authentication methods on your Cognitive Services account, instead use Azure Active Directory identities.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-cognitive-services-account' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and (properties.disableLocalAuth does not exist or properties.disableLocalAuth is false) 
----


|*Azure Machine learning workspace is not configured with private endpoint*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-126235

|This policy identifies Azure Machine learning workspaces that are not configured with private endpoint. Private endpoints in workspace resources allow clients on a virtual network to securely access data over Azure Private Link. Configuring a private endpoint enables access to traffic coming from only known networks and prevents access from malicious or unknown IP addresses which includes IP addresses within Azure. It is recommended to create private endpoint for secure communication for your Machine learning workspaces.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-machine-learning-workspace' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and (properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] does not exist or properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] is empty or (properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] exists and properties.privateEndpointConnections[*].properties.privateLinkServiceConnectionState.status does not equal ignore case Approved))
----


// |*Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) container service that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0)*

// tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-126309 (removing per Slack comment from Giri)

// |This policy identifies Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) container services that are internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0). Container services with unrestricted access to the internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorized access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

// *Policy Severity—* High

// *Policy Type—* NetworkConfig

// ----
// config from network where source.network = '0.0.0.0/0' and address.match.criteria = 'full_match' and dest.resource.type = 'K8s Service' and dest.cloud.type = 'AZURE' and effective.action = 'Allow'
// ----


// |*AWS EKS K8s service that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0)*

// tt:[*24.2.2*] (removing per Slack comment from Giri)

//RLP-126545

// |This policy identifies AWS EKS K8s service that are internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0).

// |*IBM Cloud Block Storage volume for VPC is not encrypted with BYOK*

//tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-127891 (removing per comment from Giri on Slack)

// |This policy identifies IBM Cloud Block storage volumes that are not encrypted with Bring Your Own keys(BYOK). As a best practice, it is recommended to use BYOK so that no one outside the organization has access to the root key and only authorized identities have access to maintain the lifecycle of the keys.

// *Policy Severity—* Information

// *Policy Type—* Config

// ----
// config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'ibm-vpc-block-storage-volume' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'ibm-key-protect-registration' as Y;filter 'not($.Y.resourceCrn equals $.X.crn)' ; show X;
// ----


|*AWS Systems Manager EC2 instance having NON_COMPLIANT patch compliance status*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-129452

|This policy identifies if the AWS Systems Manager patch compliance status is "NON_COMPLIANT" with critical or high severity for managed instances. Instances labeled non-compliant might lack essential patches for security, stability, or meeting standards. Non-compliant instances pose security risks because attackers often target unpatched systems to exploit known weaknesses. As a security best practice, it's recommended to apply any missing patches to the affected instances.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ssm-resource-compliance-summary' AND json.rule = Status equals "NON_COMPLIANT" and ComplianceType contains "Patch" and ResourceType contains "ManagedInstance" and (NonCompliantSummary.SeveritySummary.CriticalCount greater than 0 or NonCompliantSummary.SeveritySummary.HighCount greater than 0)
----


|*Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud set to Off for Databases*

|*AWS IAM AWSCloudShellFullAccess policy is attached to IAM roles, users, or IAM groups*

tt:[*24.2.1*]

//RLP-126214

|Identifies the AWSCloudShellFullAccess policy attached to IAM roles, users, or IAM groups. AWS CloudShell is a convenient way of running CLI commands against AWS services. The 'AWSCloudShellFullAccess' IAM policy, providing unrestricted CloudShell access, poses a risk of data exfiltration, allowing malicious admins to exploit file upload/download capabilities for unauthorized data transfer. As a security best practice, it is recommended to grant least privilege access like granting only the permissions required to perform a task, instead of providing excessive permissions.
