|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*AWS Log metric filter and alarm does not exist for AWS Organization changes*

tt:[*24.2.1*]

//RLP-126231

|Identifies the AWS regions that do not have a log metric filter and alarm for AWS Organizations changes. Monitoring changes to AWS Organizations will help to ensure any unwanted, accidental, or intentional modifications that may lead to unauthorized access or other security breaches within the AWS account. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to AWS Organization's configurations.

NOTE: This policy will trigger an alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial enabled, Logs all management events in your account, and is not set with a specific log metric filter and alarm.

*Policy Severity—* Information

*Policy Type—* Config

|*AWS Log metric filter and alarm does not exist for usage of root account*

tt:[*24.2.1*]

//RLP-126208

|identifies the AWS regions that do not have a log metric filter and alarm for usage of a root account. Monitoring for root account logins will provide visibility into the use of a fully privileged account and an opportunity to reduce its use it. Failure to monitor root account logins may result in a lack of visibility into unauthorized use or attempts to access the root account, posing potential security risks to your AWS environment. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to CloudTrail's configurations.

NOTE: This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial is enabled, Logs all management events in your account and is not set with specific log metric filter and alarm.

|*AWS IAM AWSCloudShellFullAccess policy is attached to IAM roles, users, or IAM groups*

tt:[*24.2.1*]

//RLP-126214

|Identifies the AWSCloudShellFullAccess policy attached to IAM roles, users, or IAM groups. AWS CloudShell is a convenient way of running CLI commands against AWS services. The 'AWSCloudShellFullAccess' IAM policy, providing unrestricted CloudShell access, poses a risk of data exfiltration, allowing malicious admins to exploit file upload/download capabilities for unauthorized data transfer. As a security best practice, it is recommended to grant least privilege access like granting only the permissions required to perform a task, instead of providing excessive permissions.

*Policy Severity—* Information

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = isAttached is true and policyName contains AWSCloudShellFullAccess and (entities.policyRoles[*].roleName exists or entities.policyUsers[*].userName exists or entities.policyGroups[*].groupName exists)
