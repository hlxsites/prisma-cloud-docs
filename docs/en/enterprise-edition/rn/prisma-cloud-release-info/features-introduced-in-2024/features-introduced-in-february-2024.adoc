[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Policies*
|*Description*


|*Azure Batch Account configured with overly permissive network access*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-69482

|This policy identifies Batch Accounts configured with overly permissive network access. By default, Batch accounts are accessible from the all networks. With an Account access IP firewall, you can restrict it further to only a set of IPv4 addresses or IPv4 address ranges. With Private access Virtual Networks, the network traffic path is secured on both ends. It is recommended to configure the Batch account with an IP firewall or by Virtual Network, so that the Batch account is accessible only to restricted entities.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

|*Azure Storage Account storing Machine Learning workspace high business impact data is publicly accessible*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-124737

|This policy identifies Azure Storage Accounts storing Machine Learning workspace high business impact data that are publicly accessible. Azure Storage account stores machine learning artifacts such as job logs. By default, this storage account is used when you upload data to the workspace. The attacker could exploit publicly accessible storage account to get machine learning workspace high business impact data logs and could breach in to the system by leveraging data exposed. It is recommended to restrict storage account access to only to the machine learning services as per business requirement.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

|*AWS account security contact information is not set*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-126209

|This policy identifies the AWS account which has not set security contact information. Providing dedicated contact information for security specific, AWS can directly communicate security advisories to the team responsible for handling security-related issues. Failure to specify security contact info in AWS risks missing critical advisories, leading to delayed incident response and increased vulnerability exposure. It is recommended to set security contact information to receive notifications.

*Policy Severity—* Information

*Policy Type—* Config

|*Azure Cognitive Services account configured with local authentication*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-126234

|This policy identifies Azure Cognitive Services accounts that are configured with local authentication methods instead of AD identity. Local authentication allows users to access the service using a local account and password, rather than an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account. Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Cognitive Services accounts require Active Directory identities exclusively for authentication. It is recommended to disable local authentication methods on your Cognitive Services account, instead use Azure Active Directory identities.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

|*Azure Machine learning workspace is not configured with private endpoint*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-126235

|This policy identifies Azure Machine learning workspaces that are not configured with private endpoint. Private endpoints in workspace resources allow clients on a virtual network to securely access data over Azure Private Link. Configuring a private endpoint enables access to traffic coming from only known networks and prevents access from malicious or unknown IP addresses which includes IP addresses within Azure. It is recommended to create private endpoint for secure communication for your Machine learning workspaces.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

|*Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) container service that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0)*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-126309

|This policy identifies Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) container services that are internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0). Container services with unrestricted access to the internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorized access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* NetworkConfig

|*AWS EKS K8s service that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0)*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-126545

|This policy identifies AWS EKS K8s service that are internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0).

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Network

|*IBM Cloud Block Storage volume for VPC is not encrypted with BYOK*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-127891

|This policy identifies IBM Cloud Block storage volumes that are not encrypted with Bring Your Own keys(BYOK). As a best practice, it is recommended to use BYOK so that no one outside the organization has access to the root key and only authorized identities have access to maintain the lifecycle of the keys.

*Policy Severity—* Information

*Policy Type—* Config


|*AWS Systems Manager EC2 instance having NON_COMPLIANT patch compliance status*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-129452

|This policy identifies if the AWS Systems Manager patch compliance status is "NON_COMPLIANT" with critical or high severity for managed instances. Instances labeled non-compliant might lack essential patches for security, stability, or meeting standards. Non-compliant instances pose security risks because attackers often target unpatched systems to exploit known weaknesses. As a security best practice, it's recommended to apply any missing patches to the affected instances.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config


|*Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud set to Off for Databases*

tt:[*24.2.2*]

//RLP-129459

|*AWS Log metric filter and alarm does not exist for AWS Organization changes*

tt:[*24.2.1*]

//RLP-126231

|Identifies the AWS regions that do not have a log metric filter and alarm for AWS Organizations changes. Monitoring changes to AWS Organizations will help to ensure any unwanted, accidental, or intentional modifications that may lead to unauthorized access or other security breaches within the AWS account. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to AWS Organization's configurations.

NOTE: This policy will trigger an alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial enabled, Logs all management events in your account, and is not set with a specific log metric filter and alarm.

|*AWS Log metric filter and alarm does not exist for usage of root account*

tt:[*24.2.1*]

//RLP-126208

|identifies the AWS regions that do not have a log metric filter and alarm for usage of a root account. Monitoring for root account logins will provide visibility into the use of a fully privileged account and an opportunity to reduce its use it. Failure to monitor root account logins may result in a lack of visibility into unauthorized use or attempts to access the root account, posing potential security risks to your AWS environment. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to CloudTrail's configurations.

NOTE: This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial is enabled, Logs all management events in your account and is not set with specific log metric filter and alarm.
