|COMPLIANCE BENCHMARK
|DESCRIPTION

|*Support for MITRE ATT&CK Cloud IaaS v13 & v14*

tt:[23.12.1]

//RLP-121584, RLP-120363

|Prisma Cloud now supports the MITRE ATT&CK Cloud IaaS v13 & v14 compliance standard. This framework includes Att&ck Tactics, Techniques and sub-techniques that attackers can leverage to compromise cloud applications and infrastructure.

You can now view this built-in standard and the associated policies on the *Compliance > Standards* page. You can also generate reports for immediate viewing or download, or schedule recurring reports to track this compliance standard over time.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Checkov update for SCA Security scanning*

tt:[Secure the Source]

tt:[23.12.1]

//RLP-112353
|Ensure Checkov or Bridgecrew CLI is updated to version 2.2.234 or later. Support for earlier versions is no longer supported.

| *Checkov CLI upgrade*

tt:[Secure the Source]

tt:[23.12.1]

//RLP-112353
| The Checkov CLI has been upgraded to Checkov 3.0. The upgrade impacts a few known changes:

* *Level Up*: This capability has been removed. This change is non-disruptive and affects only Bridgecrew standalone sign ups.
* *Multi-Signatures*: Multi-signatures in Python checks are being removed. This will only impact custom Python policies using this method.
* *Deprecating flags for Suppression and Fix*: CLI command of `--skip-fixes` and `--skip-suppressions` are being deprecated. Instead `--skip-download` is a recommended command.
* *API Key Restriction and Repo-ID Parameter*: Scans with  API keys will now require the --repo-id parameter for repository scans allowing for easier platform mapping.
* *Enhanced Argument Handling*: The way to specify frameworks and skip frameworks will align to other flags where multiple values can be listed (like --check). For example: `--framework terraform,arm`..
* *Pyston Docker Build Deprecation*: The Pyston Docker build has been depreciated due to increasing complexities in support. The regular Checkov image will still be available for use.
