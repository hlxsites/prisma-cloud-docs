|*Policy Updates*
|*Description*

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS EKS cluster does not have secrets encryption enabled*
//RLP-156100

|*Changes–* The policy is updated to identify EKS clusters with versions lesser than 1.28 as per the latest CSP updates.

*Current Description–* 

This policy identifies AWS EKS clusters that do not have secrets encryption enabled.

AWS EKS cluster secrets are, by default, stored unencrypted in the API server's underlying data store (etcd). Anyone with direct access to etcd or with API access can retrieve or modify the secrets. Using secrets encryption for your Amazon EKS cluster allows you to protect sensitive information such as passwords and API keys using Kubernetes-native APIs.

It is recommended to enable secrets encryption to ensure its security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

*Updated Description–*

This policy identifies AWS EKS clusters that do not have secrets encryption enabled. 

AWS EKS cluster secrets are, by default, stored unencrypted in the API server's underlying data store (etcd). Anyone with direct access to etcd or with API access can retrieve or modify the secrets. Using secrets encryption for your Amazon EKS cluster allows you to protect sensitive information such as passwords and API keys using Kubernetes-native APIs. 

It is recommended to enable secrets encryption to ensure its security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. 

NOTE: The policy identifies secret encryptions for EKS clusters with versions lesser than 1.28. 

*Current RQL–* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-eks-describe-cluster' AND json.rule = encryptionConfig does not exist or (encryptionConfig exists and encryptionConfig[*].provider.keyArn does not exist and encryptionConfig[*].resources[*] does not contain secrets)
----

*Updated RQL–*
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-eks-describe-cluster' AND json.rule = version is member of ( "1.25", "1.26", "1.27") and (encryptionConfig does not exist or (encryptionConfig exists and encryptionConfig[*].provider.keyArn does not exist and encryptionConfig[*].resources[*] does not contain secrets))
----

*Policy Type–* Config

*Updated Description–*

This policy identifies Azure SQL servers which have public network access setting enabled. Publicly accessible SQL servers are vulnerable to external threats with risk of unauthorized access or may remotely exploit any vulnerabilities.
