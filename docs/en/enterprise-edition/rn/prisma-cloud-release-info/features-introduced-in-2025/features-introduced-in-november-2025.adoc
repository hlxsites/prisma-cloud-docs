|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Enhanced Alma Linux vulnerability assessment*

// CWP-63936

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.03.138]

|Vulnerability assessments for Alma Linux are significantly improved due to the integration of CVEs from Alma Linux security advisories (currently, for releases 8 and 9) into the Intelligence Stream. This enhancement provides a more comprehensive and accurate picture of security risks, ultimately improving the security of Alma Linux 8 and 9 systems. 


|*Support for RHEL 10*

// CWP-63973

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.03.138]

|This release includes full support for RedHat Enterprise Linux 10. 


|*NVD score utilization and impact*

// CWP-64072

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.03.138]

|NVD traditionally provides two scores: a primary score from NIST and a secondary score from other sources. Previously, the secondary score was not used, even when the primary score was unavailable. 

*Updated behavior:*

. If the NVD primary score is missing and a CISA ADP secondary score is available, the secondary score will be used as the CVE score (for example,  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8671).

. Once the NVD primary score becomes available, it will revert to being the CVE score.

*Note:* The secondary score is used only if the primary score is not available and the secondary score is based on a CISA-ADP evaluation.

*Impact on vulnerability reporting:*

This improvement will lead to a change in how vulnerabilities are classified. Previously, vulnerabilities without a score, would be assigned a score of “0" and were categorized as "Low" severity. With this enhancement, they will now be assigned the CVSS and severity provided by CISA-ADP. This could result in an increase of up to 0.58% in the total number of reported Medium, High, or Critical vulnerabilities.
