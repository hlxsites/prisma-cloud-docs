|*Collect pod labels*

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.02.133]

|If you enable the Collect Deployment and Namespace Labels toggle while deploying a defender, an environment variable, COLLECT_POD_LABELS is set to true in the YAML file or helm chart. Orchestrator defenders that are deployed with this setting use the Kubernetes API while scanning to collect labels of the deployment and namespace resources that contain the pods hosting the containers.

This feature is enhanced to support a new environment variable, COLLECT_POD_RESOURCE_LABELS. After enabling the Collect Deployment and Namespace Labels toggle, if you add this variable and set it to true, the Orchestrator defenders also collect labels of the pod containing the container.

Together these two environment variables support the use case of accessing the labels assigned using the command: kubectl label pod.

You can view these labels in the container details tab, or retrieve them from the externalLabels and labels fields in the response of the API
