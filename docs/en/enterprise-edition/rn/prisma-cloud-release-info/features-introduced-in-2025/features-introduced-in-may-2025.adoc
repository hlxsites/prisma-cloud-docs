|*RedHat Enterprise Linux 10 incompatibility with  WAAS Defender Agent*
//CWP-63673

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.01.126]

|RedHat https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_networking[deprecated iptables in RHEL 9] and the upcoming RHEL 10 will not support iptables.

The WAAS defender agent deployed directly on RHEL10 (as Host Defender), which relies on iptables, is incompatible with RHEL 10 due to this change. 

NOTE: Containerized varieties of the WAAS Defender will continue to work.

=== Enhancements
[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Enhanced fsmon monitoring process*
//CWP-63480

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.01.126]

|To enhance the handling of file system events in the runtime, a new version, fsmon_v2, has been developed. This version improves stability by managing timeouts more promptly and robustly, which reduces bottlenecks and enhances overall stability.

Starting from this release (version 34.01), fsmon_v2 is the default file system monitoring process and runs by default when the defender launches.


|*Support for Oracle Linux as Base Image*
//CWP-63235

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.01.126]

|Prisma Cloud now provides runtime protection for containers that use Oracle Linux as the base layer.

|*Support for mounted paths*
//CWP-63332

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.01.126]


|A new environment variable (`HOST_FIM_MOUNTS`) enables you to specify additional host mounted paths for runtime monitoring. By incorporating these specified paths into all applicable policies, this feature provides enhanced flexibility in monitoring critical mounted paths within your environment.

The value of this new variable is a colon separated list of the additional mountpoints to track, for example: `/mnt/mountpoint1:/mnt/mountpoint2`.

To update the environment variable:

. Add or modify the new environment variable in the deployment file to include the desired mounted paths for monitoring.

. Deploy the Defender with the new environment variables to activate monitoring of the new paths.


|*New environment variable for configuring the number of image external labels*
//CWP-63653

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.01.126]

|A new environment variable -- `IMAGE_EXTERNAL_LABELS_CAP`, enables configuration of the maximum number of external labels (indirect labels collected by Prisma Cloud) that are allowed for an image. The default value is 100, and the maximum configurable value is 1024. This variable is applicable to both Console and Defenders.

*Important Considerations:*

* External labels, such as Kubernetes Namespace and Deployment labels, as well as cloud tags, are collected and stored per container.

* This limit is specific to external labels collect per image and doesn't impact existing container limitations.

* External labels are not inherent image properties and are not be displayed if a container is not scanned (for example, short-lived containers).


|*Vulnerabilities and Compliance data available as PDF files*
//CWP-63654

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.01.126]


|You can now download the data shown on the following pages as PDF files:

* Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Images & Hosts

* Monitor > Compliance > Containers, Images & Hosts


|*Runtime protection for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6*
//CWP-63655 

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.01.126]

|Prisma Cloud now supports runtime protection of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 images.


|*Ingestion of Azure VNet Flow Logs*
//RLP-133585

|Prisma Cloud now supports the ingestion of https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/connect/connect-cloud-accounts/onboard-your-azure-account/connect-azure-account#:~:text=Virtual%20Network%20flow%20logs[VNet flow logs] in addition to the existing ingestion of NSG flow logs, for Microsoft Azure account onboarding. VNet flow logs will also be added as a data source to existing Azure policies. There will be no impact to existing tenants and no additional action is needed.

|*Ingestion of AWS ca-west-1 Resources*
//RLP-15602

|Prisma Cloud AWS resource discovery is now extended to resources on AWS ca-west-1 (Canada/Calgary). With this added ingestion support, assets in this region are discoverable on the *Asset Inventory* page. No additional action is needed.

|*AWS S3 bucket not configured with secure data transport policy*
//RLP-155761

|*Changesâ* Policy description updated to include the publicly accessible check.

*Policy Type*: Config

*Policy Severity*: Medium

*Impact*: No impact on alerts

*Updated Description*: 
----
AWS S3 buckets that are publicly accessible and lacking secure data transport are highly susceptible to data breaches during transit.
AWS S3 buckets should enforce data encryption using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to protect data transmitted between clients and the S3 service. Failure to enforce HTTPS allows attackers to intercept sensitive data in transit, leading to data exposure and potential breaches. Additionally, because the bucket is publicly accessible, untrusted IPs can access sensitive data without encryption.
The impact of this misconfiguration includes unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, and potential regulatory fines. Enforcing HTTPS ensures all communication with publicly accessible S3 buckets is encrypted, protecting data confidentiality and integrity.
To mitigate this, configure bucket policies to explicitly deny all access except via HTTPS ('aws:SecureTransport: true') and remove public access permissions. Regularly review and update bucket policies to reflect evolving security needs and ensure that public access is minimized or removed.

|*Deprecation of the CNNS feature*
// CWP-63175

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.01.126]

|The âCloud Native Network Segmentation (CNNS) feature is deprecated for the enforcement of protection against network threats for both containers and hosts. However, in scenarios where alternative network monitoring modes are unavailable, it can be used only for monitoring, such as radar visibility. The current recommendation is to disable all CNNS-based network monitoring as well.
