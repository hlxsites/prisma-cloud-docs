2+|*Policy Updates—Metadata*

|*AWS S3 bucket publicly writable*
//RLP-157351

|*Policy Update–* A note is added to the description indicating the exclusion of S3 buckets hosting public static websites.

*Current Description–* 

Publicly writable AWS S3 buckets allow unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within. This misconfiguration exposes data to malicious actors and data breaches.

The S3 service relies on Access Control Lists (ACLs) and bucket policies to manage access. Incorrectly configured ACLs or bucket policies that grant 'Put', 'Create', 'Update', 'Replicate', 'Write', or 'Delete' permissions to the world, allow anyone to modify or delete bucket contents. This exposes data to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.

A successful attack could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, resulting in significant financial, legal, and reputational damage. Best practices dictate strict control over S3 bucket permissions to prevent unauthorized access. Data loss and compliance violations are possible consequences.

Implement least privilege access controls. Restrict access to only trusted users and services via appropriately configured ACLs and bucket policies. Regularly review and audit S3 bucket permissions to identify and rectify any misconfigurations. Use strong encryption to protect data at rest and in transit. Employ multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security. 


*Proposed Description–* 

Publicly writable AWS S3 buckets allow unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within. This misconfiguration exposes data to malicious actors and data breaches.

The S3 service relies on Access Control Lists (ACLs) and bucket policies to manage access. Incorrectly configured ACLs or bucket policies that grant 'Put', 'Create', 'Update', 'Replicate', 'Write', or 'Delete' permissions to the world, allow anyone to modify or delete bucket contents. This exposes data to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.

A successful attack could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, resulting in significant financial, legal, and reputational damage. Best practices dictate strict control over S3 bucket permissions to prevent unauthorized access. Data loss and compliance violations are possible consequences.

Implement least privilege access controls. Restrict access to only trusted users and services via appropriately configured ACLs and bucket policies. Regularly review and audit S3 bucket permissions to identify and rectify any misconfigurations. Use strong encryption to protect data at rest and in transit. Employ multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security. 

*Note*: This policy excludes AWS S3 buckets that are configured to host public static websites.
