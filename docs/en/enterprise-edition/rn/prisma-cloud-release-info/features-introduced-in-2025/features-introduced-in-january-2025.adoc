=== Enhancements
[cols="30%a,70%a"]

|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Microsoft Entra ID Visibility*

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[25.1.1]

|Enhancements to Prisma Cloud's Cloud Infrastructure and Entitlement Management (CIEM) capabilities provide greater visibility and control over Microsoft Azure Entra ID permissions, helping you secure your identities with greater efficiency. You can now investigate not only Azure but also Entra ID specific permissions, such as identifying entities with the Global Administrator role. Use the `grantedby.level.type` attribute in combination with all existing RQL queries to investigate Entra ID permissions.


|*Enhancements to Vulnerability Reporting for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Versions 8 and 9*
//CWP-30827

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.03.138]
|To ensure accurate vulnerability reporting, Intelligence Stream will include RPM module and stream information for RHEL in the reports. This approach improves detection of vulnerabilities and ensures that all associated RPM packages installed by a module are examined during the scan.

*What are RPM Modules and Streams?*

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), an RPM module is a collection of related RPM packages that represent a software component, such as an application, its dependencies, and helper utilities. Starting with RHEL 6 and 7, modules replaced the Software Collections mechanism.

Modules are structured in the following way:

* *Module Streams*: Virtual repositories within the AppStream repository. Each stream corresponds to a specific version of the module and receives independent updates.

* *Stream Activation*: At any time, only one stream of a module can be active, meaning only one version of a component can be installed on a system.

For example, the notation `python39:3.9/python39` indicates the module `python39`, the stream `3.9`, and the source package `python39`.

*Enhancements to Vulnerability Reporting*

* *Module-Based Vulnerability Identification*: Scans will report vulnerabilities based on the module and stream configuration. This ensures accurate detection and avoids false positives or false negatives caused by discrepancies in versioning or backported fixes.

* *Inclusion of RPM Module Metadata in Scan Results*: The enhanced implementation associates RPM packages with their respective modules and streams. The Prisma Cloud console will include this module information in vulnerability scan results.


*Benefits of Module-Aware Vulnerability Reporting*

* *Improved Accuracy*: Matches CVE fixes to the correct module stream.
* *Reduced False Positives*: Avoids misreporting of vulnerabilities fixed in older streams.
* *Comprehensive Coverage*: Links all RPM packages installed by a module to its vulnerabilities.

*NOTE*: 

* This enhancement requires upgrading Defenders to the latest version. 

* The older versions of Defender will remain unaffected by this change, and their behavior remains unchanged.

|*Enhanced Vulnerability Reporting for NuGet Packages*
//CWP-49786

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.03.138]
|Previously, the scanning process included NuGet packages listed in the `.deps.json` files, which were essential for the runtime environment but not related to the application itself. These unrelated packages result in false positives in vulnerability reporting. 

With this enhancement, the scanning process excludes runtime-specific dependencies that are not directly related to the application. This provides a more accurate view of vulnerabilities directly associated with the application, and reduces false positive alerts.

*NOTE*: 

* This enhancement requires upgrading Defenders to the latest version. 

* The updated Defender accurately identifies package dependencies, which leads to fewer false positives.

* The older versions of Defender will remain unaffected by this change, and their behavior remains unchanged.

|*Enhancement to Prevent Action with `fsmon_v2`*
//CWP-62711

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.03.138]

|To enhance the handling of file system events for the Prevent Action in the Runtime Policy, a new version, fsmon_v2, has been developed. This version improves stability by managing timeouts more promptly and in a robust manner, thereby reducing bottlenecks and enhancing overall stability.

While `fsmon_v2` brings significant improvements, it is still under active development, and further enhancements are planned. Currently, `fsmon_v2` is being rolled out gradually. 

This feature is disabled by default. Customers who want to activate this feature should submit a ticket requesting engineering to enable it.

|"last-connected" Field Added to Defender Stats Logs
//CWP-62666

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.03.138]
|A new field, last-connected, has been added to each Defender stats log. This field records the last confirmed connection time between the Defender and the Console, even when the Connected flag is set to false. The timestamp is represented in epoch seconds (UTC), providing customers with a reliable way to track connection history.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Custom IAM Policies Alert Triggers*

tt:[24.1.1]
//RLP-153861

|Starting with the current release, custom policies regarding unused permissions will trigger alerts when there is zero usage of the action with `""` regex across any of the destinations. If the action has been used on at least one resource that matches the `""` regex, the alert will be resolved.

*Impact—* This change may impact existing alerts for unused permissions with `*` and could potentially dismiss them.
