|*Description*


|*Enhanced Remediation*
//RLP-144840

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[25.1.1]

|Enhanced Remediation improves the quality and effectiveness of Prisma Cloud security alert remediation guidance. It leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to assist your teams in enhancing remediation content for existing alerts and policies, while ensuring all recommendations undergo review and validation. The recommendations now provide AI-assisted remediation steps for Critical and High Alerts. It provides you with a seamless and intuitive experience allowing you to quickly access and understand the remediation steps.

* *Alerts* includes a new *Enhanced Remediation* Saved View. When you select *Enhanced Remediation* filter option as *Yes*, you can view the alerts that you can resolve using enhanced remediation.

* Click the *Alert ID* to view the new *How to Fix* tab (previously known as Recommendations) with the various remediation options.
+
image::enhanced-remediation-4.png[]

* Expand the accordion to fix the alert with either *Manual Remediation in Console* (previously known as Recommendation Steps), *Remediate with Terraform Template*, or *Remediate with CLI Command*.
+

There are multiple clickable boxes for each finding that are part of the Attack Path. For individual alerts, such as standalone policies, there is only one box. For alerts or policies that do not have Terraform or CLI, only Manual remediation is available.

//* The *Policy* table includes a new *AI Remediation* column.


|*Microsoft Entra ID Visibility*
//RLP-153639

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[25.1.1]

|Enhancements to the Cloud Infrastructure and Entitlement Management (CIEM) capabilities provide greater visibility and control over Microsoft Azure Entra ID permissions, helping you secure your identities with greater efficiency. You can now investigate not only Azure but also Entra ID specific permissions, such as identifying entities with the Global Administrator role. Use the `grantedby.level.type` attribute in combination with all existing RQL queries to investigate Entra ID permissions.


|*ARM Framework Support for Custom Build Policies*
//BCE-35801

tt:[Secure the Source]

tt:[25.1.1]

|You can now create https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/governance/custom-build-policies/custom-build-policies[custom build policies] that include ARM. These policies can be applied to both ARM and Bicep using shared arguments and syntax, or you can restrict the policy to either ARM or Bicep. Additionally, the ARM framework now supports both explicit and implicit dependencies.


|*Enhancements to Vulnerability Reporting for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Versions 8 and 9*
//CWP-30827

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.03.138]
|To ensure accurate vulnerability reporting, Intelligence Stream includes RPM module and stream information for RHEL in the reports. This approach improves detection of vulnerabilities and ensures that all associated RPM packages installed by a module are examined during the scan.

*What are RPM Modules and Streams?*

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), an RPM module is a collection of related RPM packages that represent a software component, such as an application, its dependencies, and helper utilities. Starting with RHEL 6 and 7, modules replaced the Software Collections mechanism.

Modules are structured in the following way:

* *Module Streams*: Virtual repositories within the AppStream repository. Each stream corresponds to a specific version of the module and receives independent updates.

* *Stream Activation*: At any time, only one stream of a module can be active, meaning only one version of a component can be installed on a system.

For example, the notation `python39:3.9/python39` indicates the module `python39`, the stream `3.9`, and the source package `python39`.

*Enhancements to Vulnerability Reporting*

* *Module-Based Vulnerability Identification*: Scans will report vulnerabilities based on the module and stream configuration. This ensures accurate detection and avoids false positives or false negatives caused by discrepancies in versioning or backported fixes.

* *Inclusion of RPM Module Metadata in Scan Results*: The enhanced implementation associates RPM packages with their respective modules and streams. The Prisma Cloud console will include this module information in vulnerability scan results.


*Benefits of Module-Aware Vulnerability Reporting*

* *Improved Accuracy*: Matches CVE fixes to the correct module stream.
* *Reduced False Positives*: Avoids misreporting of vulnerabilities fixed in older streams.
* *Comprehensive Coverage*: Links all RPM packages installed by a module to its vulnerabilities.

*NOTE*: 

* This enhancement requires upgrading Defenders to the latest version. 

* The older versions of Defender will remain unaffected by this change, and their behavior remains unchanged.

|*Enhanced Vulnerability Reporting for NuGet Packages*
//CWP-49786

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.03.138]
|Previously, the scanning process included NuGet packages listed in the `.deps.json` files, which were essential for the runtime environment but not related to the application itself. These unrelated packages result in false positives in vulnerability reporting. 

With this enhancement, the scanning process excludes runtime-specific dependencies that are not directly related to the application. This provides a more accurate view of vulnerabilities directly associated with the application, and reduces false positive alerts.

*NOTE*: 

* This enhancement requires upgrading Defenders to the latest version. 

* The updated Defender accurately identifies package dependencies, which leads to fewer false positives.

* The older versions of Defender will remain unaffected by this change, and their behavior remains unchanged.

|*Enhancement to Prevent Action with `fsmon_v2`*
//CWP-62711

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.03.138]

|To enhance the handling of file system events for the Prevent Action in the Runtime Policy, a new version, fsmon_v2, has been developed. This version improves stability by managing timeouts more promptly and in a robust manner, thereby reducing bottlenecks and enhancing overall stability.

While `fsmon_v2` brings significant improvements, it is still under active development, and further enhancements are planned. Currently, `fsmon_v2` is being rolled out gradually. 

This feature is disabled by default. Customers who want to activate this feature should submit a ticket requesting engineering to enable it.

|"last-connected" Field Added to Defender Stats Logs
//CWP-62666

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[33.03.138]
|A new field, last-connected, has been added to each Defender stats log. This field records the last confirmed connection time between the Defender and the Console, even when the Connected flag is set to false. The timestamp is represented in epoch seconds (UTC), providing customers with a reliable way to track connection history.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*New Rate Limits for Search API*
//RLP-151274

|To improve user experience and enhance search performance, rate limits are implemented for the following APIs:

* *Config Search*
** https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/search-config/[search/config]
** https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/search-config-page/[search/config/page]

* *Config Search v1*
** https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/search-config-by-query/[search/api/v1/config]

Request Rate Limit = 150

*Impact—* Requests exceeding the limits will result in an *HTTP 429* Too Many Requests response. See Prisma Cloud API guidance on https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/rate-limits/[Rate Limits].


|*Custom IAM Policies Alert Triggers*
//RLP-153861

|Custom policies regarding unused permissions will trigger alerts when there is zero usage of the action with `""` regex across any of the destinations. If the action has been used on at least one resource that matches the `""` regex, the alert will be resolved.

*Impact—* This change may impact existing alerts for unused permissions with `*` and could potentially dismiss them.


|*Downgraded Permissions Required to Onboard GitLab*
//RLP-153897

|`Organization owner` permissions are no longer required for integrating https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/application-security/get-started/connect-code-and-build-providers/code-repositories/add-gitlab#user-permissions[GitLab SaaS] or https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/application-security/get-started/connect-code-and-build-providers/code-repositories/add-gitlab-selfmanaged[GitLab on-prem]. `Maintainer` permissions are sufficient. This change enhances security by adhering to the principle of least privilege.

|*Azure Container Registry with anonymous authentication enabled*
//RLP-153633

|This policy identifies Azure Container Registries with anonymous authentication enabled, allowing unauthenticated access to the registry.

Allowing anonymous pull or access to container registries poses a significant security risk, exposing them to unauthorized users who may retrieve or manipulate container images. To enhance security, disable anonymous access and require authentication through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Additionally, turn off local authentication methods such as admin user, repository-scoped access tokens, and anonymous pull to ensure authentication relies solely on Azure AD, providing improved control and accountability.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to disable anonymous authentication for Azure Container Registries.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-container-registry' AND json.rule = (skuName contains Standard or skuName contains Premium) and properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and properties.anonymousPullEnabled is false 
----

|*Azure Container Registry with ARM audience token authentication enabled*
//RLP-153634

|This policy identifies Azure Container Registries that permit ARM audience tokens for authentication.

When ARM audience tokens are enabled, they allow authentication intended for broader Azure services, which could introduce potential security risks. Disabling ARM audience tokens ensures that only ACR-specific tokens are valid, enhancing security by limiting authentication exclusively to Azure Container Registry audience tokens.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to disable ARM audience tokens for Azure Container Registries.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-container-registry' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and properties.policies.azureADAuthenticationAsArmPolicy.status contains enabled 
----

|*Azure Container Registry with local admin account enabled*
//RLP-154109

|This policy identifies Azure Container Registries having local admin account enabled.

Enabling the admin account allows access to the registry through username and password, bypassing Microsoft Entra ID authentication. Disabling the local admin account improves security by enforcing exclusive use of Microsoft Entra ID identities, which provide centralized management, enhanced auditing, and better control over permissions. By relying solely on Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, the risk of unauthorized access through local credentials is mitigated, ensuring stronger protection for your container registry.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to disable local admin account for Azure Container Registries.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' and api.name = 'azure-container-registry' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and properties.adminUserEnabled is true 
----

|*Azure Container Registry with repository scoped access token enabled*
//RLP-154110

|This policy identifies Azure Container Registries having repository scoped access tokens enabled.

Disable repository-scoped access tokens for your registry to prevent access via tokens. Enhancing security involves disabling local authentication methods, including admin user, repository-scoped access tokens, and anonymous pull. This ensures that container registries rely solely on Microsoft Entra ID identities for authentication.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to disable repository scoped access token for Azure Container Registries.

|*Azure Container Registry not encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK)*
//RLP-154111

|This policy identifies Azure Container Registries that are not encrypted with Customer-Managed Keys (CMK).

By default, Azure Container Registry encrypts data at rest with Microsoft-managed keys. However, for enhanced control, regulatory compliance, and improved security, customer-managed keys enable organizations to encrypt Azure Container Registry data using Azure Key Vault keys that they create, own, and manage. Using CMK ensures that the encryption process aligns with organizational policies, allowing complete control over key lifecycle management, including rotation, access management, and retirement.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to encrypt Azure Container Registries with Customer-Managed Keys (CMK).

|*Azure Container Registry with exports enabled*
//RLP-154112

|This policy identifies Azure Container Registries with exports enabled.

Azure Container Registries with exports enabled allows data in the registry to be moved out using commands like acr import or acr transfer. Export functionality can expose registry data, increasing the risk of unauthorized data movement. Disabling exports ensures that data in a registry is accessed only via the dataplane (e.g., docker pull) and cannot be moved out using other methods.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to disable export configuration for Azure Container Registries.

|*GCP Memorystore for Redis instance not encrypted with CMEK*
//RLP-153619

|This policy identifies Memorystore for Redis instances not encrypted with CMEK.

GCP Memorystore for Redis is a fully managed in-memory data store that simplifies Redis deployment and scaling while ensuring high availability and low-latency access. By using CMEK with Redis instance, you retain complete control over the encryption keys protecting your sensitive data, ensuring that only authorized users with access to these keys can decrypt and access the information. Without CMEK, data is encrypted with Google-managed keys, which may not provide the level of control required for handling sensitive data in certain industries.

It is recommended to encrypt Redis instance data using a Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMEK).

//RLP-153620

|This policy identifies GCP Memorystore for Redis instances with no in transit encryption.

GCP Memorystore for Redis is a fully managed in-memory data store that simplifies Redis deployment and scaling while ensuring high availability and low-latency access. When in-transit encryption is disabled, all data transmitted between your clients and Redis flows as plaintext over the network, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and packet sniffing, potentially exposing sensitive information like session tokens, personal data, or business secrets.

It is recommended to enable In transit encryption for GCP Memorystore for Redis to prevent malicious actors from intercepting sensitive data.

GCP Memorystore for Redis is a fully managed in-memory data store that simplifies Redis deployment and scaling while ensuring high availability and low-latency access. When AUTH is disabled, any client that can reach the Redis instance over the network can freely connect and perform operations without providing any credentials, creating a significant security risk to your data.

It is recommended to enable authentication (AUTH) on the GCP Memorystore for Redis to ensure only authorized clients can connect.

//RLP-154140

|This policy identifies GCP Storage buckets that have object versioning disabled.

Object versioning is a method of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same storage bucket. Enabling object versioning on storage log buckets will protect your cloud storage data from being overwritten or accidentally deleted.

It is recommended to enable the object versioning feature on all storage buckets.

|*Azure VM disk configured with public network access*
//RLP-153728

|The policy name and description are updated.

*Current Policy Name–* Azure VM disk configured with public network access

*Updated Policy Name–* Azure VM disk configured with overly permissive network access

*Current Policy Description–* This policy identifies Azure Virtual Machine disks that are configured with public network access.

Allowing public access to Azure Virtual Machine disk resources increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Public network access exposes sensitive data to external threats, which attackers could exploit to compromise VM disks. Disabling public access and using Azure Private Link reduces exposure, ensuring only trusted networks have access and enhancing the security of your Azure environment by minimizing the risk of data leaks and breaches.

As a security best practice, it is recommended to disable public network access for Azure Virtual Machine disks.

*Updated Policy Description–* This policy identifies Azure Virtual Machine disks that are configured with overly permissive network access.
