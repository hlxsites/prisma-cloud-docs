|*Cloud Discovery Enhancements*
//CWP-63247

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.00.137]

|
. *AWS Fargate for Amazon ECS:* Cloud Discovery now includes data about ECS Fargate containers, including their defended/undefended status. 
. *Azure Container Instances (ACI):* Cloud Discovery now includes data for all containers in container groups. Previously, data for only the first container was included.

. *Google Cloud Run:* Cloud Discovery now includes data for all containers in GCP Cloud Run container groups. Previously, no data was collected and shown for containers in GCP Cloud Run.

. *Identify Account ID attribution for app-embedded defenders used for defending CaaS assets:* The Account ID was previously available for ECS Fargate and Google Cloud Run. This release adds the support for displaying the Account ID for ACI as well. With this release:

.. ECS Fargate and GCP Cloud Run: the Account ID was already shown for: i) Fargate defenders; and ii) App-embedded defenders installed on GCP Cloud Run.

.. Azure Container Instances (ACI): In this release, Account ID is shown for app-embedded defenders installed on ACI containers after you perform the following steps for each container:

... Upgrade the defender to the Quinn release.
... Create a managed identity.
... Assign the Reader role to the newly created managed identity. 
... Assign the newly created managed identity to the container group. 


|*Jira Authentication Update for Prisma Cloud Runtime Alerts*
//CWP-63063

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.00.137]

|Jira Cloud has deprecated Basic Authentication with passwords and now requires API tokens for authentication. When integrating Prisma Cloud Runtime with Jira as an alert provider, you must use an API token instead of a username-password combination.

*Required Actions*

To set up a new alert profile for Jira Cloud users, do the following:

. Generate an API token from your Jira Cloud account.
+ 
For more information, see https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/[Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account] topic in Jira Documentation site.
. Save the token in Prisma Cloud’s Credentials Store and use this new credential when adding a new Jira Alert profile.
+ 
For more information, see https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/runtime-security/alerts/jira#adding-api-tokens-in-credentials-store-for-jira-cloud-authentication[Adding Jira Cloud Credentials] topic in the Prisma Cloud Admin Guide.

To update an existing alert profile for Jira Cloud users, do the following:

. Generate an API token from your Jira Cloud account.
+ 
For more information, see https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/[Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account] topic in the Jira Documentation site.

. Update the credentials by replacing the password with the API token.
+ 
For more information, see https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/runtime-security/alerts/jira#updating-jira-cloud-credentials-to-use-an-api-token[Updating Jira Cloud Credentials] topic in the Prisma Cloud Admin Guide.


To set Up a new alert profile for Jira Data Center (DC) users, do the following:

. Generate a personal access token from your Jira DC account.
+
For more information, see https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html[Using Personal Access Tokens] topic in the Jira Documentation site.

. Configure the credentials using Basic Authentication with your username and the personal access token as the password when adding a new Jira Alert profile.

|*Better utilization of vendor-specific feeds*
//CWP-63066

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.00.137]

|The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides a valuable baseline CVSS score for vulnerabilities. However, vendors often have a more granular understanding of how a specific vulnerability impacts their implementation of a component. This allows them to provide a more accurate CVSS score, especially when considering environmental factors and the specific ways their product utilizes the vulnerable component. In some cases, vendor-specific vulnerability feeds may have the latest CVSS scores before they are reflected in NVD.


This release leverages additional data from vendor-specific vulnerability feeds, such as those from RedHat, Photon OS, and Ruby Gems, and implements several improvements in the extraction and reporting of CVSS scores. These changes provide more accurate and timely CVSS scores, reflecting the latest vendor-specific mitigations, configurations, and environmental impacts.

*RedHat Security Feed:*
//CWP-62974

* Previously, if a CVE had a CVSS score of 0 in the RedHat security feed, we used the CVSS score provided by NVD for that CVE.

* Now, we use the CVE data and the CVSS score provided by the RedHat feed even if the CVSS score is 0 in the RedHat feed. This ensures that we consider RedHat's specific assessment, which might indicate a mitigated or non-impactful vulnerability in their context.

*Photon OS Security Feed:*
//CWP-62976

* Previously, we extracted CVSS scores for CVEs from the NVD for Photon OS vulnerabilities.

* Now, we use the CVSS scores provided in the Photon OS security feed. This allows us to reflect Photon OS-specific mitigations and impacts more accurately.

*Ruby Gems Security Feed:*
//CWP-62977

* Previously, we ignored the CVSS scores reported by RubySec (https://github.com/rubysec and https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db) and used the values from NVD.

* Now, we use the CVSS values provided in the Ruby Advisory DB. This ensures we capture the precise impact and mitigations for Ruby Gems vulnerabilities as assessed by RubySec.

*Amazon Linux Security Feed:*
//CWP-62754)

* Previously, we extracted CVSS scores for Amazon Linux vulnerabilities/CVEs from the NVD.

* Now, we use the CVSS scores provided in the Amazon Linux  security feed. This allows us to reflect Amazon Linux-specific mitigations and impacts more accurately.

*Fallback to NVD CVSS Scores*

If the vendor feed does not provide a CVSS value for any CVE, then the CVSS value from the NVD will be used. This ensures that we always have a CVSS score to guide our risk assessment and mitigation efforts.


|*Customization for Scanning Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)*
//CWP-49786

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.00.137]

|Prisma Cloud now offers on-prem users greater flexibility in selecting AMIs.

For on-prem users, the following environment variables enable customization: 

* `AGENTLESS_USE_CUSTOM_AMI` – Enables or disables the use of custom AMIs.

* `AGENTLESS_CUSTOM_AMI_PER_REGION` – Specifies custom AMIs per AWS region

*Example Configuration:*

`AGENTLESS_USE_CUSTOM_AMI=true`
`AGENTLESS_CUSTOM_AMI_PER_REGION='{"us-east-1":"ami-005fc0f236362e99f"}'`

In this example, the custom AMI (`ami-005fc0f236362e99f`) is used in the 'us-east-1' region.
 
*Behavior Based on Configuration:*

* If `AGENTLESS_USE_CUSTOM_AMI` is `false`, Prisma Cloud falls back to the previous scanner image, which is Ubuntu 20.04.

* If `AGENTLESS_USE_CUSTOM_AMI` is set to `true` but `AGENTLESS_CUSTOM_AMI_PER_REGION` is not set, Prisma Cloud uses the LaunchDarkly (LD) custom AMI list.

* If `AGENTLESS_USE_CUSTOM_AMI` is not set, Prisma Cloud defaults to the LD custom AMI list.

* For Cloud (SaaS) users, no action is required—Prisma Cloud automatically selects the latest optimized AMI.

|*Description*

|Removal of Stale Hosts and Images
//CWP-62948

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.00.137]

|We’re implementing a fix that will remove outdated assets that are no longer protected by a Defender. These assets should have been automatically deleted previously, but were not.
With this update, you might notice that certain stale assets are no longer present in your inventory. As a result, you might also see a reduction in vulnerabilities and compliance findings due to their removal.

|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*AWS Lightsail bucket accessible to unmonitored cloud accounts*
//RLP-155140

|*Policy Description—* AWS Lightsail buckets with permissions granted to unmonitored cloud accounts pose a significant security risk. These buckets, offering internet-accessible storage, could be compromised if unauthorized accounts gain access.

Lightsail buckets provide object storage, allowing data retrieval from anywhere. Granting 'read' access to unmonitored cloud accounts introduces a substantial risk. Attackers might exploit this misconfiguration to exfiltrate sensitive data or inject malicious content, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.

To mitigate this risk, restrict access to Lightsail buckets to only explicitly trusted and monitored cloud accounts. Only trusted and monitored cloud accounts should possess the necessary permissions.

Regularly review and audit bucket permissions, removing access for any unmonitored or untrusted accounts. Implement robust monitoring and alerting to detect any unauthorized access attempts.

|*AWS Lightsail bucket publicly readable*
//RLP-155141

|*Policy Description—* Publicly readable objects in AWS Lightsail buckets expose sensitive data to unauthorized access, increasing the risk of data breaches and reputational harm.

AWS Lightsail provides object storage through buckets, enabling data storage and retrieval. A misconfiguration allowing public readability exposes all stored data. Untrusted parties can freely access this information, leading to data exfiltration, intellectual property theft, and financial losses.

To mitigate this risk, enforce the principle of least privilege. Restricting bucket access to authorized users is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.

Configure bucket permissions to be private, only granting access to specific users or groups needing it. Regularly review and audit bucket access controls to detect and address any misconfigurations promptly.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

----

|*AWS Lightsail bucket object versioning is disabled*
//RLP-155138

|*Policy Description—* AWS Lightsail buckets lacking object versioning are susceptible to data loss and unauthorized modification. Disabling this feature removes the ability to revert to previous versions of objects after accidental deletion or malicious alteration.

Lightsail buckets provide object storage, allowing data access from anywhere. Object versioning creates version history for every object stored. Without versioning, accidental deletion or malicious overwrites result in permanent data loss, severely impacting data integrity and potentially leading to business disruption or data breaches. Attackers could exploit this misconfiguration to permanently delete or modify critical data.

To mitigate this risk, enable object versioning on all AWS Lightsail buckets, this ensures data recoverability, protecting against accidental or malicious actions and mitigating the risk of significant data loss.

Regularly review bucket configurations to ensure object versioning remains active. Implement robust access control mechanisms.

*Policy Severity—* Low
