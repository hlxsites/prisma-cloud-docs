[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

[cols="40%a,60%a"]
|===
|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*AWS Lightsail bucket accessible to unmonitored cloud accounts*
//RLP-155140

|*Policy Descriptionâ* AWS Lightsail buckets with permissions granted to unmonitored cloud accounts pose a significant security risk. These buckets, offering internet-accessible storage, could be compromised if unauthorized accounts gain access.

Lightsail buckets provide object storage, allowing data retrieval from anywhere. Granting 'read' access to unmonitored cloud accounts introduces a substantial risk. Attackers might exploit this misconfiguration to exfiltrate sensitive data or inject malicious content, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.

To mitigate this risk, restrict access to Lightsail buckets to only explicitly trusted and monitored cloud accounts. Only trusted and monitored cloud accounts should possess the necessary permissions.

Regularly review and audit bucket permissions, removing access for any unmonitored or untrusted accounts. Implement robust monitoring and alerting to detect any unauthorized access attempts.

*Policy Severityâ* Medium

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
`config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-lightsail-storage-bucket' AND json.rule = 'readonlyAccessAccounts is not empty and _AWSCloudAccount.isRedLockMonitored($.readonlyAccessAccounts[*]) is false'`
----

|*AWS Lightsail bucket publicly readable*
//RLP-155141

|*Policy Descriptionâ* Publicly readable objects in AWS Lightsail buckets expose sensitive data to unauthorized access, increasing the risk of data breaches and reputational harm.

AWS Lightsail provides object storage through buckets, enabling data storage and retrieval. A misconfiguration allowing public readability exposes all stored data. Untrusted parties can freely access this information, leading to data exfiltration, intellectual property theft, and financial losses.

To mitigate this risk, enforce the principle of least privilege. Restricting bucket access to authorized users is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.

Configure bucket permissions to be private, only granting access to specific users or groups needing it. Regularly review and audit bucket access controls to detect and address any misconfigurations promptly.

*Policy Severityâ* High

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-lightsail-storage-bucket' AND json.rule = accessRules.getObject equal ignore case public as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-s3control-public-access-block' AND json.rule = blockPublicAcls is false or blockPublicPolicy is false or ignorePublicAcls is false or restrictPublicBuckets is false as Y; filter '$.X.arn contains $.Y.accountId' ; show X;
----

|*AWS Lightsail bucket object versioning is disabled*
//RLP-155138

|*Policy Descriptionâ* AWS Lightsail buckets lacking object versioning are susceptible to data loss and unauthorized modification. Disabling this feature removes the ability to revert to previous versions of objects after accidental deletion or malicious alteration.

Lightsail buckets provide object storage, allowing data access from anywhere. Object versioning creates version history for every object stored. Without versioning, accidental deletion or malicious overwrites result in permanent data loss, severely impacting data integrity and potentially leading to business disruption or data breaches. Attackers could exploit this misconfiguration to permanently delete or modify critical data.

To mitigate this risk, enable object versioning on all AWS Lightsail buckets, this ensures data recoverability, protecting against accidental or malicious actions and mitigating the risk of significant data loss.

Regularly review bucket configurations to ensure object versioning remains active. Implement robust access control mechanisms.

*Policy Severityâ* Low

*Policy Typeâ* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-lightsail-storage-bucket' AND json.rule = objectVersioning does not equal ignore case Enabled
