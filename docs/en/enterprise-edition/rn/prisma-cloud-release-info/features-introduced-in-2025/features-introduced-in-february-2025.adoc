|*Description*

|*IAM Enhancement*
//RLP-154591

|Updates to the IAM capabilities allow you to map users by filtering results using userPrincipalName (UPN). You can now use the existing `grantedby.level.type`, `grantedby.level.name`, and `grantedby.level.id` attributes in RQL queries to identify users by their UPN. For example:

----
config from iam where grantedby.level.type = 'Azure Resource Group'
----


|*CIEM Enhancement*
//RLP-154592

|Enhancements to the Cloud Infrastructure and Entitlement Management (CIEM) capabilities provide greater visibility and control over Microsoft Azure permissions at the resource group level, helping you secure your identities with greater efficiency. You can now use the existing `grantedby.level.type`, `grantedby.level.name`, and `grantedby.level.id` attributes in RQL queries to investigate resource group specific Azure permissions. For example:

----
`config from iam where grantedby.level.type = 'Azure Resource Group'`
----

These APIs now restrict data fetching to when the database is in the 'Online' or 'Ready' states. This ensures operations are only performed during these optimal states. This targeted approach prevents data fetching in any other non-active states effectively reducing costs and improving performance.

Behaviour when the database transitions into a 'Paused' state or any other non-optimal state:

* Data ingestion for affected resources is suspended.
* The deleted status for these specific resources in Prisma is set to 'true'.
* All alerts related to the paused resources are automatically marked as resolved during this pause.

Upon the database's return to an 'Online' state, and when data ingestion recommences:

* The 'deleted' status in Prisma is reverted to 'false'.
* Any alerts that were marked as resolved during the pause are reopened.

|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*AWS S3 Buckets Block public access bucket policy setting disabled*
//RLP-154813

|*Policy Description—* AWS S3 buckets with the 'Block public access' setting disabled or 'Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies' setting or 'Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies' disabled pose a significant security risk, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The 'Block public access' setting in Amazon S3 controls public accessibility of buckets and objects. Disabling this setting, either intentionally or through misconfiguration, exposes data to the internet, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modification, or ransomware attacks by malicious actors or accidental exposure.

The impact of this misconfiguration can range from data loss and regulatory non-compliance to reputational damage and financial losses. Enabling this setting ensures only authorized users can access the data, minimizing the risk of data breaches and improving overall security posture.

To mitigate this risk, enable the 'Block all public access' setting for all S3 buckets. Alternatively, use 'Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies' and 'Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies', depending on your specific requirements. Regularly review and audit S3 bucket configurations to prevent accidental or malicious changes.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name='aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = "((publicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist or publicAccessBlockConfiguration.blockPublicPolicy is false) and (accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist or accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.blockPublicPolicy is false)) or ((publicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist or publicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false) and (accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist or accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false))"
----

|*AWS S3 Buckets Block public access ACL setting disabled*
//RLP-154810

|*Policy Description—* AWS S3 buckets with 'Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)' setting or 'Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)' disabled.

The "Block public access" setting within AWS S3 bucket configurations controls public accessibility. Disabling this setting exposes stored data to the internet, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or complete data loss through malicious actors exploiting this misconfiguration. Untrusted entities could gain access, compromising sensitive information.

The impact of this misconfiguration can range from data loss and regulatory non-compliance to reputational damage and financial losses. Enabling this setting ensures only authorized users can access the data, minimizing the risk of data breaches and improving overall security posture.

To mitigate this risk, ensure all S3 buckets have the "Block public access" setting enabled or 'Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)' setting or 'Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)' for all AWS s3 buckets appropriately. Regularly review and audit S3 bucket configurations to identify and remediate any instances where this setting is disabled. Implement strong access control lists (ACLs) and consider using other security measures such as encryption and multi-factor authentication to enhance protection.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name='aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = "((publicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist or publicAccessBlockConfiguration.blockPublicAcls is false) and (accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist or accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.blockPublicAcls is false)) or ((publicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist or publicAccessBlockConfiguration.ignorePublicAcls is false) and (accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist or accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.ignorePublicAcls is false))"

|*AWS S3 bucket having ACL write permission to all users or allAuthenticatedUsers*
//RLP-154597
|*Policy Description—* This policy identifies AWS S3 buckets having ACL write permission to all users or allAuthenticatedUsers.

AWS S3 Access Control Lists (ACLs) offer granular control over object access within a bucket. Granting "Write" or "FullControl" permissions to "AllUsers" or "AuthenticatedUsers" poses a significant security risk, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access or modification. Best practices emphasize restricting access to only authorized users and groups based on the principle of least privilege.

To mitigate this risk, configure S3 bucket policies and ACLs to explicitly grant permissions to specific users or groups requiring access.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = policyStatus.isPublic is true and acl.grants[?any( grantee is member of ( 'AllUsers', 'AuthenticatedUsers' ) and permission is member of (Write,FullControl) )] exists

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*Azure Function App doesn't use latest TLS version*
//RLP-153936

|*Changes—* The policy description and reccomendation steps are updated. Also, the RQL policy is updated to consider the latest TLS version 1.3.

*Current Description–* 
This policy identifies Azure Function Apps that are not set with the latest version of TLS encryption. Azure currently allows the Function App to set TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. Using the latest TLS 1.2 version for Function App secure connections is highly recommended.

*Updated Description–*
This policy identifies Azure Function App which are not set with the latest version of TLS encryption.

Azure currently allows the Function App to set TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer regarded as secure protocols and are deemed outdated.

As a security best practice, TLS 1.2 or above is typically advised as the minimum TLS version for Azure function apps.

|*GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for VPC network changes*
//RLP-153451
|*Changes—* The policy description and reccomendation steps are updated align with current standards of the policy. Also, the RQL is updated to stay in line with the CSP changes.

*Current Description–* 
This policy identifies the GCP account which does not have a log metric filter and alert for VPC network changes. Monitoring network insertion, patching, deletion, removePeering and addPeering activities will help in identifying VPC traffic flow is not getting impacted. It is recommended to create a metric filter and alarm to detect activities related to the insertion, patching, deletion, removePeering and addPeering of VPC network.

*Updated Description–*
This policy identifies GCP accounts that do not have a log metric filter and alert for VPC network changes.

Without proper monitoring of activities like network insertions, patching, deletions, and peering modifications, organizations risk undetected misconfigurations that could compromise network security and impact traffic flow. Real-time alerts on these events are crucial for rapid response to malicious activity or accidental changes, ensuring network integrity and availability. Establishing these monitoring capabilities provides a critical layer of visibility and control over VPC network configurations.

It is recommended to create a log metric filter and alert configuration in your GCP project for VPC network changes. This will enable proactive detection of unauthorized modifications and ensure the integrity and security of your VPC network.

|*GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for VPC Network Firewall rule changes*
//RLP-153453
|*Changes—* The policy description and reccomendation steps are updated align with current standards of the policy. Also, the RQL is updated to stay in line with the CSP changes.

*Current Description–* 
This policy identifies the GCP account which does not have a log metric filter and alert for VPC network changes. Monitoring network insertion, patching, deletion, removePeering and addPeering activities will help in identifying VPC traffic flow is not getting impacted. It is recommended to create a metric filter and alarm to detect activities related to the insertion, patching, deletion, removePeering and addPeering of VPC network.

*Updated Description–*
This policy identifies GCP projects that do not have log metric filters and alerts for VPC Network Firewall rule modifications.

VPC Network Firewall rules govern network traffic flow, and unauthorized changes can severely impact security and availability. Without real-time monitoring and alerting on rule modifications (additions, deletions, or updates), organizations are vulnerable to undetected attacks, misconfigurations, and performance issues. Proactive alerts enable swift responses to suspicious activity, preventing breaches and ensuring business continuity. Implementing this monitoring provides crucial visibility and control over network security posture.

It is recommended to configure log metric filters and alerts within your GCP projects to monitor all VPC Network Firewall rule changes. This will enable prompt detection of unauthorized modifications, facilitating rapid remediation and maintaining the integrity and security of your network infrastructure.

|*GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for Project Ownership assignments/changes*
//RLP-153450
|*Changes—* The policy description is updated to better align with the policy.

*Current Description–* 
This policy identifies the GCP account which does not have a log metric filter and alert for Project Ownership assignments/changes. Project Ownership Having highest level of privileges on a project, to avoid misuse of project resources project ownership assignment/change actions mentioned should be monitored and alerted to concerned recipients.

*Updated Description–*
This policy identifies GCP projects that do not have log metric filters and alert for project ownership assignments and changes.

Project ownership grants extensive privileges. Without monitoring ownership changes, organizations risk unauthorized access, resource misappropriation, and potential security breaches. Real-time alerts on ownership transfers enable prompt detection of suspicious activity, facilitating rapid response and minimizing the impact of compromised accounts. Establishing this monitoring provides crucial visibility and control over project access, improving overall security posture.

It is recommended to configure log metric filters and alerts for project ownership changes in all GCP projects. This proactive approach ensures that any changes to project ownership are immediately flagged, allowing for timely investigation and mitigation of potential risks.

*Policy Type–* Config

*Policy Severity–* Informational

*Impact–* Low. New alerts will be generated for the failing resources.

|*GCP IAM user with service account privileges*
//RLP-153760
|*Changes—* The policy name and description are updated to better align with the policy.

*Current Policy Name–* GCP IAM user with service account privileges

*Updated Policy Name–* GCP IAM principals with service account privileges

*Current Description–* This policy identifies IAM users which have overly permissive service account privileges. Any user should not have Service Account Admin and Service Account User, both roles assigned at a time. Built-in/Predefined IAM role Service Account admin allows the user to create, delete, manage service accounts. Built-in/Predefined IAM role Service Account User allows the user to assign service accounts to Apps/Compute Instances. It is recommended to follow the principle of 'Separation of Duties' ensuring that one individual does not have all the necessary permissions to be able to complete a malicious action or meant to help avoid security or privacy incidents and errors.

*Updated Description–* This policy identifies IAM principals which have overly permissive service account privileges.

Assigning a principals the Service account role in Google Cloud allows them to  impersonate service accounts and use their permissions. This means the principals can perform actions on behalf of the service account, essentially inheriting all permissions granted to that service account.

To maintain the security of your information and resources, it is crucial to assign this role only to authorized and trusted IAM Principals. 

*Policy Type–* Config

*Policy Severity–* Low

*Impact–* No impact on alerts.

|*Policy Name*
|*Description*

2+|*IAM Policy Updates—Metadata*

|*AWS IAM policy allows access and decrypt Secrets Manager Secrets permissions*
//RLP-154372
|*Changes—* The IAM policy name is updated as follows.

*Current Policy Name–* AWS IAM policy allows access and decrypt Secrets Manager Secrets permissions

*Updated Policy Name–* AWS EC2 with access to read and decrypt Secret Manager Secrets

2+|*IAM Policy Updates—Deletion*

|*AWS EC2 with IAM role with destruction permissions for AWS Key Management Service (KMS)*
//RLP-154372
|*Changes—* This IAM policy has been deleted. Instead, use *AWS EC2 with access to read and decrypt Secret Manager Secrets* to receive alerts for policy violations.

*Impact—* 

* Previously generated alerts will be resolved as `Policy_Deleted`. 

* New alerts will be generated for policy violations based on *AWS EC2 with access to read and decrypt Secret Manager Secrets* policy.


|===

*IAM Policy Updates—Severity*
//RLP-154372

Prisma Cloud updated the policy severity levels based on updated risk assessment.

*Note—* These changes are reflective of previously intended changes (version 24.11.1) which did not take place due to internal circumstances.

*Impact—* 

* Your existing open alerts associated with updated policies will have a change in their severity levels.
* If you have Alert rules set up based on the *Policy Severity* filter, there may be a decrease or increase in the number of alerts.
* The overall Compliance posture may change due to possible alert number changes.
* If you change a custom severity of a policy back to the default severity, the new severity update will apply.

[NOTE]
====
This update will not affect the severities of your custom policies or the system default policies for which you have manually changed the severities (custom severity). 
Also, if you have included a policy in at least one other alert rule `(not based on severity filter)], there will be no change in the alert numbers.
