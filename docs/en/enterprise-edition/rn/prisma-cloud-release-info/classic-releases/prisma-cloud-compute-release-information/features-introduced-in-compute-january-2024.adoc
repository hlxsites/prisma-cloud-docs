[#defender-upgrade]
=== Defender Upgrade

[cols="30%a,70%a"]
|===
|Plan to Upgrade Defender Versions 22.12 and Earlier
|With the `v32.00` (O'Neal) release, Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2) are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.
To prepare for this update, you must upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.12` (Lagrange) or earlier to a later version. Failure to upgrade Defenders will result in disconnection of any Defender version below `v30.00`, such as `v22.12`.
