|Plan to Upgrade Defender versions
|With the `v32.00` (O'Neal) release, Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2) are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.
To prepare for this update, upgrade your Defenders from version `v30.xx` or an earlier release to a later version. Any defender versions before the `v30.xx` release, like `v22.xx` cannot connect to the current version.
|Upcoming Defender Obsolescence
|With the upcoming `v33.00` release, the release `v30.xx` defenders will be obsolete. To prepare for this upcoming update, plan your defender upgrade to release `v31.xx` or later.

|*FEATURE*
|*DESCRIPTION*

//CWP-56798
|*Blobstore Scanning Defender Upgrade for Tanzu Customers*
|Enhanced the existing `blobstore` scanning feature for Tanzu customers. As a part of this enhancement, existing `blobstore` scanning defenders will now appear disconnected and new defender instances will be automatically created to replace them. The disconnected `blobstore` will disappear after 24 hours as part of the retention process. This upgrade excludes Linux and Windows defenders (Full coverage defenders).
If you have have configured `blobstore` scanning and assigned it to a specific `blobstore` defender after the release of 32.04, you are required to manually edit the configurations and change it to a newly created `blobstore` defender scanner. This release will also introduce a new tile support - jammy for TAS.

//CWP-56557
|*Added Account ID information to the Defenders dashboard*
|Added *Account ID* to the manage Defenders dashboard under *Manage > Defenders*.
The *Account ID* is also included in the downloadable CSV file.

//CWP-56782
|*Enhanced the vulnerability assessment process*
|Prisma Cloud now has an enhanced vulnerability assessment process for applications installed through the OS.
If Prisma Cloud can't detect any vulnerabilities in the vendor feed, it automatically searches for third-party security data to ensure comprehensive security coverage.
Go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer* for a comprehensive list of the detected vulnerabilities.

|*Added a new macro for webhook alerts*
|Added the `incidentTime` macro for webhook alerts. The macro shows the time the incident occurred.
For example, `Jan 21, 2018 UTC`.
Go to https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/classic/compute-admin-guide/alerts/webhook[Alerts Webhook] to learn more about the macro.

//CWP-56790

|Defenders now support the extractions of Go packages on Windows.
This package extraction allows the Prisma Cloud Defenders to extract Go packages in zip, tar.gz, or tar.bz2 formats.

//CWP-56791
|*Exclude Go CVEs for Windows from the CVEs of Unix-based systems*
|Prisma Cloud now excludes vulnerabilities found in Go packages that are specific to Windows from UNIX based operating systems in the *Vulnerability Explorer*.
