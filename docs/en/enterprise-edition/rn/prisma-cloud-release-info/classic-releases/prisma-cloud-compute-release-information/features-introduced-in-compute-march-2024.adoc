=== Defender Upgrade

[cols="30%a,70%a"]
|===
|Plan to Upgrade Defender versions
|With the `v32.00` (O'Neal) release, Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2) are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.
To prepare for this update, upgrade your Defenders from version `v30.xx` or an earlier release to a later version. Any defender versions before the `v30.xx` release, like `v22.xx` cannot connect to the current version.
|Upcoming Defender Obsolescence
|With the upcoming v33.00 release, the release v30.xx defenders will be obsolete. To prepare for this upcoming update, plan your defender upgrade to release v31.xx or later.
