|*ISSUE ID*
|*DESCRIPTION*


|*Impact of AWS SDK for Java v1.x EOL on Prisma*
//RLP-157987

|AWS is ending support for AWS SDK for Java v1.x. As a result some customers may experience a temporary warning that AWS SDK for Java v1.x is no longer supported, even if it is not present in their environment.This warning can be disregarded. The SDK is exclusively employed by the Prisma Cloud server and does not introduce any risk to your environment. All SDK-related runtimes are confined to the Prisma Cloud server side. The use of the legacy SDK does not impact your AWS environment in any manner.

Prisma will be updating to AWS SDK for Java 2.x in an upcoming release. 


|*Azure Permission Removal*
//RLP-157865

tt:[26.2.1]

|Azure has deprecated the following permission required to ingest resources. This permission will be removed as a requirement in a future release.

* `Microsoft.Orbital/spacecrafts/read`


|*Ingested Findings Sources*
//RLP-156989

tt:[25.12.1]

|If Prisma Cloud Compute is enabled on a specific resource or account and you have configured it to ingest data from third party sources such as Tenable, Qualys or AWS inspector, Prisma will only list findings from Compute and not from third party sources for that particular resource. 

//(removing line per comment from dev on ticket) Before enabling AWS Inspector integration on Prisma Cloud, keep the following in mind:

//* With AWS Inspector Classic you can ingest old findings which were detected on AWS.
//* With AWS Inspector Next Version you cannot ingest old findings which were detected on AWS. 


|*Live Status Check Limitation*

tt:[25.12.1]

|If you have only configured *VNet flow logs*, the *Flow Log* component will display a red status (error) during the Live Status Check. This behavior is expected due to current limitations and does not affect account onboarding or flow log ingestion. 


|*Flow Logs Ingestion Limitation*

tt:[25.12.1]

|MDC configuration ingestion does *not* currently ingest metadata from *Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set* that are required for Flow Logs decoration (VPC identification). As a result, you cannot run RQL queries using the *Virtual Network* filter when the traffic is generated by an *Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set*. You can still run queries using other filters, such as *Source IP* and *Destination IP*.

|*Vulnerability data for Windows hosts*
//CWP awaited from Moshe

tt:[34.02.133]

|*Vulnerability Data Access Issue in Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition (Windows CSA only)*

*Issue*

Users of Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition are currently experiencing an issue preventing access to vulnerability details detected by cloud security agents (CSA) on Windows hosts. This data is inaccessible through both the user interface and the API.

*Clarification*

It is important to note that this issue solely affects the access to vulnerability data. Cloud security agents are successfully detecting and reporting vulnerabilities, and the underlying data remains intact. All historical and newly detected vulnerability data will become available once this access issue is resolved.

*Resolution Timeline*

Palo Alto Networks is actively working on a fix for this critical issue. A resolution is expected to be deployed and made available to users early next week. Please monitor official communication channels for updates regarding the fix's availability and implementation steps.


|*RLP-156679*
 
tt:[25.8.1]

|*Issues Found Warning during Onboard or Update*

You may encounter an *Issues Found Warning* under *Security Capabilities and Permissions > Misconfigurations > Asset* configuration when onboarding or updating your AWS cloud accounts. This warning lists the required permissions for various API services.

You can safely ignore this warning message. It is trigerred by the `backup:ListRecoveryPointsByBackupVault` permission for the `aws-backup-recovery-point` API. The API is disabled by default.


|*CWP-63673*
//CWP-63673

tt:[34.01.126]

|*RedHat Enterprise Linux 10 incompatibility with Defender Agents*

RedHat https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_networking[deprecated iptables in RHEL 9] and does not support iptables in RHEL 10.

The WAAS defender agent, when deployed on RHEL10, relies on iptables and is incompatible with RHEL 10 due to this change.


|*Host details display incorrect Windows version*
//CWP-63632

tt:[34.01.126]

|Windows Server 2025 is incorrectly reported as Windows Server 2022 on the Host details panel. 

|*PCSUP-28459*

|The total count of alerts detected may sometimes increase even if assets in your tenant are not updated. Transient changes with CSP APIs, may sometimes lead to this intermittent issue.

|*PCSUP-27662*

|Prisma Cloud Application Security *Home > Projects > Repositories* has a known limitation where, selecting *Repositories All* when generating a CSV scan report does not generate a report with a full list of all available repositories. Results are limited to a maximum of 500. 


|*RLP-155997*  

|When entering an RQL query, if the specified conditions are met for the `aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status` API, rotation and policy data (specifically in the fields `keyRotations` and `keyPolicies` in the config JSON) will not be ingested. The conditions include:

- `KeyMetadata.Origin` being one of ('EXTERNAL', 'AWS_CLOUDHSM')
- `KeyMetadata.KeyManager` being `AWS`
- `KeyMetadata.Description` starting with `Default master`

As a result of these conditions, the list of related assets for `aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status` API will not be visible.

|*RLP-155983*  

|Prisma Cloud uses EventBridge keys to authenticate events in the webhook, and these keys do not support key rotation. If you receive alerts for these keys 365 days after their setup due to the violation of 'AWS Secrets Manager - Ensure unmanaged secrets are rotated at least every 365 days' policy, you will not be able to resolve these alerts by rotating the keys.

*Resolution*— Alerts must be manually dismissed for each account. You can also perform bulk dismissal to resolve these alerts.

// tt:[Found in 34.00]
// PCSUP-26952

|*Google Cloud Run Functions (Gen2) May Not Be Scanned with Selective Registry Scanning*

Google offers serverless functions in two versions: Cloud Functions ("Gen1") and Cloud Run Functions ("Gen2"). Prisma Cloud fully supports vulnerability scanning for Gen1 functions.

For Gen2, when code is uploaded to Google Cloud Run Functions, a container image is created and stored in Google Artifact Registry (GAR) or Google Container Registry (GCR). If Prisma Cloud is set to scan all registries in your GCP account, Gen2 function images will be scanned. To view results, check the relevant registry and refer to Google's naming conventions for container images https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/names[here].

If Prisma Cloud is configured to scan only selected repositories, the specific repository used by Cloud Run might not be scanned. We are working to support Gen2 function scanning in this scenario.

|*CWP-62339*

|*Discrepancies in Vulnerability Scan Results*

In rare instances, discrepancies were observed between vulnerability scan results from Defender and `twistcli` host scans. 

For example, certain compliance checks identified by `twistcli` were not reflected in Defender scan results, and vice versa. Additionally, for some operating systems, `twistcli` reported a higher number of high-severity findings compared to Defender.

|*—* 
//PCSUP-26700
|Even though non-System Administrators do not have the permission required to activate subscriptions, the *Subscribe* button is displayed for various modules under *Subscriptions*.  

*Resolution*—There is no impact on system behavior since Prisma Cloud runs a check, which prevents non-System Administrators from activating the subscription even if they click *Subscribe*.


|*RLP-155193*

|Prisma Cloud only ingests resources for the *Google Vertex AI AIPlatform API* (*gcloud-vertex-ai-aiplatform-index*) API in the following regions where the service is available according to the https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/locations#feature-availability[Cloud Service Provider].

* us-west4

*Impact*— You may encounter the `Matching Engine is not supported` error in regions that are not used or where the API service is not supported.


|*RLP-154249*

|On the Prisma Cloud Console, Config policies that use the `azure-disk-list` API, such as "Azure VM disk configured with public network access," are generating false positive alerts. These alerts are automatically resolved as 'Resource_Updated' due to an ongoing issue with the Azure Cloud Service Provider (CSP). The Disks - List Azure Resource Manager REST API is returning inconsistent or partial JSON responses. Due to this, you may notice a discrepancy in the number of Alerts associated with such policies.

*Resolution*—An Azure Support Ticket #2412030030007291 regarding the inconsistent responses from the Disks - List Azure Resource Manager REST API has been raised. We are currently awaiting a resolution from Azure CSP.

*Workaround*— If you encounter alerts that appear to be incorrect, you have the option to manually Dismiss or Snooze those alerts. Alternatively, if you prefer to manage all alerts at once, you can disable the "Azure VM disk configured with public network access" policy and re-enable it once the issue is resolved.

*Impact*— Disabling the affected policy will affect all resources governed by it. However, disabling the policy will resolve all the existing alerts and prevent new alerts from being triggered for policy violations.

|*RLP-154164*

|With 24.11.1 release, we updated rule metadata for config policies in the backend. This updated the last modified date of custom policies too. As a result you may see a recent `Last Modified date` for some custom config policies, even if no changes were made. This does not have any impact on the policy evaluation and does not change the functional behaviour of the policies.   

|*CWP-59515*

|*K8s Defender Crash Loop on RKE2*

The K8s defender pods on the RKE2 go into a crash loop if the defender is deployed using the default YAML file options.

*Workaround*: For Kubernetes defenders on RKE2, create the YAML file with the “SELinux Policy” option. This workaround is applicable to RKE2 only.

// |*CWP-62358*

// |*Incorrect Version Detection for Go Binaries with Missing Dependencies*

//When a Go binary has no listed dependencies in its build information (verified using `go version -m <path to binary>`), the version of its external dependencies is used to identify the version of the Go binary. This could result in incorrect vulnerability data.

|*RLP-152525*

|The resource URL on the *Alerts Overview* page is generated by evaluating the resource metadata present in the alert. In some cases, some of the resource metadata is not available to Prisma Cloud and hence the generated URL may be incorrect.

|*RLP-153383*
//PCSUP-25655

|Prisma Cloud does not support the ingestion of GCP Storage buckets with the `locationType` `Dual-region`.  

*Impact*: You may notice a mismatch between GCP Storage Bucket counts and the total number of GCP Storage Buckets listed in your GCP Project on Prisma Cloud.


|*RLP-153057*
//PCS-4515, PCS-4556, PCS-5228

|To provide enhanced performance, the *Compliance*/*Asset Inventory* trendline has been disabled for some tenants.

//To provide enhanced performance, the *Compliance* trendline has been disabled for very large tenants that have tens of millions of Assets.
//Removed *Workaround* based on PCS-5228: Contact Prisma Cloud Customer Support to get it re-enabled for your tenant.

|*RLP-150999*
//added on 10/24 with 24.11.1 - check whether it shd be under Fixed?

|Cloud resources located in disabled regions may trigger policy violations, resulting in false positive alerts. You may notice these misleading alerts associated with specific OOTB policies.

*Workaround*: You must manually dismiss these false positive alerts.

|*RLP-151696*
//added on 10/11/2024

|Some invalid assets related to accounts for which the cloud scan was not completed will be deleted.

*Impact*: Open alerts on such existing invalid assets, where asset type is `Account Aggregate Entity` will get resolved.


|*RLP-152263*
//added on 10/10/2024, revised on 10/11

|In certain cases, a system processing issue is causing deviations in the total, passed, and failed assets count. 


*Impact*: Inaccurate overall asset counts will be displayed on *Asset Inventory* and *Compliance Dashboard* for some customers. 

//move blurb under fixed-issues once fix/patch is deployed in 24.10.1 or .2? -- Fixed a race condition (Was causing deviations in total, pass, fail counts on the asset inventory and compliance pages) in Asset Inventory and Compliance Dashboard. This fix will provide more accurate overall asset counts for some customers. 

|*RLP-149425*

|To ingest the `gcloud-cloud-domains-registration` API, you need the Viewer role or any least permissive built in roles such as Cloud Domains Viewer or Cloud Domains Admin, which includes the permissions `domains.registrations.list` and `domains.registrations.getIamPolicy`.

Custom roles cannot be configured to include these permissions, as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) does not permit it. As a result, Prisma Cloud will be unable to ingest the `gcloud-cloud-domains-registration` API when using a custom role.

*Impact*: If the Viewer role or domain related built in role is correctly configured, ingestion of the `gcloud-cloud-domains-registration` API will proceed as expected.

If the Viewer role or domain related built in role is not configured, the API ingestion will fail, and `'Missing Permissions'` warning for the above permissions will not be displayed on the account status page.

|*RLP-146718*
//Added on 8/14/2024 after 24.8.1

|In UEBA, the *Excessive Login Failures* policy is impacted by the use of multithreading for processing audit log events. Due to splitting of events, in rare occurrences there is a possibility that an incident (false negative) may not be detected. 
//Resolution (add when it is moved to Fixed): Once the analytic is moved to ETL, Prisma Cloud will effectively handle the issue without impacting the performance and time to alert.


|*RLP-143404*
//Added in 24.6.2

|On some Prisma Cloud stacks, the state of a few alerts generated for *Attack Path* policies was displayed as Open instead of Resolved. This was caused due to an issue, which is now fixed. However, currently the impacted alerts do not display the correct state.


|*RLP-128421*
//Added in 24.4.1

|When you filter assets associated with the *Azure AD B2C tenants* in the Europe region, you may notice that assets listed on the *Inventory* page under *Region ID* and *Region* columns incorrectly display as GCP Europe instead of Azure Europe. However, you can safely assume that the assets listed under the *Region* and *Region ID* columns are Azure Europe instead of GCP Europe.

*Workaround*: To verify the correct region, search for the `location` field in the asset’s JSON.

|*RLP-133698*
//Added in 24.3.2

|If an Azure account being scanned is of account type Tenant, then Prisma cloud excludes AZURE_MONITOR_ACTIVITY_LOG_ALERT, AZURE_MONITOR_LOG_PROFILE, and ACCOUNT_AGGREGATE_ENTITY asset types from the scan.

|*RLP-129856*
//Added in 24.3.2

|While testing integrations with third-party tools such as Jira, Webhook, Splunk, and Microsoft Teams in Prisma Cloud, "Unsecure url protocol" error may be displayed.

*Workaround*: Update all URLs used during the setup process from *HTTP* to *HTTPS* to resolve the error. This update ensures a more secure connection without impacting your existing alert notifications.

If you do not want to update the URLs from HTTP to HTTPS, you can choose to ignore the error. This will not have any impact on your existing alert notifications.

|*RLP-132750*
//Added in 24.3.2

|The following errors may occur when you onboard your OCI tenant to Prisma Cloud:

* *Either tenant ocid or user ocid or home region is incorrect or insufficient permissions.*
* *Authentication Failed. Check Account Details.*

You can safely ignore these errors. They occur due to the migration of OCI tenants from Oracle Identity Domains (IDCS) to the new OCI IAM on the OCI cloud services, resulting in a significant delay in activating the user API Keys used for OCI Cloud Account Onboarding.

To verify successful onboarding, go to *Settings > Providers > Cloud Accounts* and ensure your account *Status* is *green* after 24 hours.

|*RLP-123335*
//Added in 23.12.1

|When configuring Jira fields in the Prisma Cloud Notification template, it is important to note that the automatic population is limited to fields specifically of types `user` and `labels`. Other field types may not be populated as expected during the setup process. This is a known issue.


|*RLP-104295*
//Added in 23.7.2. 
|Prisma Cloud has fully adopted Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for monitoring Azure instances. However, in very rare cases, you might come across log entries for calls from Prisma Cloud to Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) endpoints. These entries can be disregarded. A fix will be implemented to resolve these erroneous entries.


|*RLP-90184*
//Raised in 23.2.1

|The behavior of filters on the *Alerts Overview* page is slightly different from that on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages. On the *Alerts Overview* page when you select the `Asset Class`, `Resource Type`, and `Service Name` filters, the alerts displayed are a combination of those three selected filters. Whereas on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages, the preference is given to `Resource Type` over `Service Name` when both those filters are selected due to which the assets for which alerts are displayed on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages do not match those displayed on the *Alerts Overview* page.


|*RLP-78777*
//Blurb shared by Arun

|The AWS Global Accelerator service returns an Access Denied error with the error assumed-role/PrismaCloudReadOnlyRole/redlock is not authorized to perform: iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole on resource. The issue occurs because the `aws-global-accelerator-accelerator`` API requires you to enable the service-linked IAM role to ingest metadata. To resolve the error, add the role to include the required permissions.

*Workaround*: If you do not want to enable the service-linked role, create a support ticket with Palo Alto Networks Technical Support to disable the AWS Global Accelerator service API.


|*RLP-73807*
|In Unified Asset Inventory, Compute alerts are not displayed in the Resource Explorer audit trail.


|*RLP-75376*
|*PCDS Azure only—* If you have enabled public access from selected IP addresses on storage account with Prisma Cloud NAT IPs and Azure outbound IPs added to the allow list, ingestion fails with 403 error (permission denied).


|*RLP-65612*
|*PCDS Azure only—* The *Inventory* page may display 400 error if data is not available.


|*RLP-65602*
|*PCDS Azure only—* During onboarding when you enter the *Client ID* and *Secret*, if the Secret exceeds the specified length, a bad request error displays.


|*RLP-68751*
|In Unified Asset Inventory, only System Administrators can view the Compute assets and not other users. Compute alerts will not be accessible on Alerts pages for all users except System Administrators.


|*RLP-65286*
//PCSUP-8439
|When integrating Prisma Cloud with Jira, if the Jira `issueType` field uses space as a separator between the words, such as `Service Request` or `New Feature` , a 500 Internal Server error occurs while configuring Typeahead fields such as Reporter or Assignee, in a Notification Template. You will be unable to create a Notification Template for Jira with the Typeahead fields.

*Workaround*: Rename the field to remove the space or add an underscore. For example, `ServiceRequest` or `New_Feature`. You can then add Typeahead fields in a Notification Template.


|*RLP-65216*
//RLP-70084, PCSUP-8587
|If you have configured multiple flow logs for a VPC and if any of the flow logs are incorrectly configured, the flow log status on Prisma Cloud is reported as a warning (Amber). This status does not impact ingestion for all the correctly configured flow logs.


|*RLP-62558*
//Raised in 23.1.2
|The resource name displayed on the Alerts L2 page does not match the name displayed for the same resource on the Asset Explorer page.


|*RLP-60005*
|Prisma Cloud may not process some of the delete bucket events, due to which the buckets that you have deleted in the AWS console will be visible in the Prisma Cloud *Inventory* page.


//*RLP-59655* - Removing per confirmation from Shital Katkar
//Prisma Cloud supports user attribution, but there may be some delay when generating user attribution for an alert, even when *Settings > Enterprise Settings > Alerts User Attribution* is enabled.


//*RLP-58180* - Removing this as a Known Issue per the ticket, marked as fixed.
//Added for PCSUP-7729 in 22.2.1.
//On *Inventory > Assets*, OKE clusters (Oracle Kubernetes Engine) deployed in Santiago region do not display.

//The *Compute* tab displays with a provisioning message for Business Edition license on the Prisma Cloud administrative console. The Compute tab should not display for the Business Edition license.


//*RLP-55763* - Removing this as a Known Issue per the ticket.
//This fix may trigger alerts to be opened or closed as applicable.


|*RLP-55036*
|When changing the *Maximum time before access keys expire* value for access keys, it may take up to 15 minutes for the updates to take effect.


//*RLP-53374*
//PCSUP-6358 - Removed per confirmation from Santosh Kadli
//On occasion, alerts generated against Network Policies can be less accurate when the policy includes the RQL attribute *dest.resource IN (resource where role*.

//In these cases, a policy match occurs because the resource such as a web server, ELB, or NAT Gateway either may not have been classified by the engine yet or the classification is no longer applicable when flow logs are analyzed to detect a violation. In such instances, you have to triage and close the alert manually.


|*RLP-40248*
//Open to review of this text.
|When you create an alert rule and specify target resource tags, Prisma Cloud processes only a single resource tag key/value pair properly. Proper processing of multiple resource tags or resource tags with multiple values is not guaranteed. This behavior exists whether you create the alert rule through the Prisma Cloud console or through the CSPM API.

//Marked as won't fix.
|When you enable Dataflow compression for a cloud account, the subnetwork creation status may display a failure message on the onboarding status page. This error displays because the time threshold to create the subnetwork and report completion exceeds the response time threshold on Prisma Cloud.

*Workaround—* Click to the previous page and click next to load the status page again.


|*RLP-13485*
|If you have the maximum number of VPCs (5) already created in the project and you then enable flowlog compression, the onboarding fails because Prisma Cloud is unable to add the network needed to enable Dataflow compression. When this happens the remediation steps in the message that displays is incorrect.

|For an application that originates from an OS package, the vulnerability data for CVEs is sourced from the relevant feed for the OS package. In some cases, like with Amazon Linux and Photon OS, this CVE information is provided in security advisories such as Amazon Linux Security Advisories (ALAS) for Amazon, and PHSA for Photon. In such cases, the correlation for the relevant vulnerabilities is limited.

As an example, when the application “python” is sourced from an Amazon Python package, CVEs found for the python application (as a binary) will not be correlated with the relevant Amazon CVEs from the ALAS.

|* With the support for ACI in cloud discovery, here are the two issues:

** Status: The `status` field currently utilizes Properties > ProvisioningState, which does not reflect the container status. For more information, refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-state[Azure Container Instances states].

** Defend: The Defend functionality does not support Azure Container Instances (ACI). The Defend functionality is enabled across all accounts and services, and when selected, it redirects to Images > Registry Settings.

|*CWP-58709*
|*Duplicate Admission Rules*

Six admission rules released in Version 32, Update 2 were found to be duplicates of older existing rules. If you need the functionality provided by these rules, we recommend disabling the old rules and using the new corresponding rules, as the older rules will be removed in an upcoming release.

The old rules and their corresponding new rules are as follows:

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - CIS - Pod created in host process ID namespace. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Baseline - Pod with containers that share host process ID (hostPID) namespace

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - CIS - Pod created on host IPC namespace. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Baseline - Pod with containers that share host IPC namespace

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - CIS - Pod created on host network. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Baseline - Pod that allows containers to share the host network namespace

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - Pod created with sensitive host file system mount. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Baseline - Pod created with sensitive host file system mount

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - CIS - Privileged pod created. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Baseline - Pod should not run privileged containers

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - CIS - Privilege escalation pod created. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Restricted - Pod that allows container privilege escalation

Note: Even though both the new and old rules are enabled by default, you will not receive duplicate alerts as only the first encountered rule is enforced.

|*Improved defender stability with Read-only 'runc' paths*

Previously, in crio environments, if the paths to `runc` were located in read-only directories, the defender would delegate the calls to the first runtime it found, increasing the risk of node instability.

This issue has now been resolved, and defender will use the default runtime. To properly deploy the newer version containing this fix, follow these steps:

. Remove the existing defender daemonset.

. Ensure that no ZZ-twistlock.conf file is present in /etc/crio/crio.conf.d. If it exists, delete it.

. Restart the affected node.

. Deploy the new defender.

|*False positives for Oracle images and hosts*

The issue with CVE matching for Oracle images and hosts, which caused false positives due to missing Oracle module information, is fixed now.


|*CWP-63043*

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.02.133]

|*False positives for OpenShift images*

False positives were reported for OpenShift images due to incorrect parsing of the release label. 

This issue is fixed now.

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[34.02.133]

|*False positives due to incorrect Red Hat version comparison*

Added support for the epoch prefix in Red Hat images. Previously, the epoch was omitted during image scanning, causing version comparisons to ignore it and resulting in false positives. This fix ensures the epoch value is included, allowing accurate version comparisons and preventing incorrect vulnerability matches.

|*Incorrect value in the CaaS containers column*

The value in the CaaS containers column in the Registry images table on the Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Image > Registries page was not updated if the Fargate task was no longer available in Prisma Cloud.

This issue is fixed now.

|*Serverless scanning of Python packages in the requirements.txt file*

Previously, dependencies in the requirements.txt file were not considered during vulnerability and compliance scans of Azure serverless functions and GCP Cloud Run functions for Python. Now, packages specified in requirements.txt are also included in the scan.

Note that for packages in the file to be taken into consideration, specific package versions need to be specified using "==". For example: 
docopt == 0.6.1

tt:[34.02.133]

|*Base image history tagging*

Scanning over 50 digests under one rule caused older base image digests to be deleted, removing base image links. The Base Image tag incorrectly remained under the Layers tab for these images. This has been fixed: the Base Image tag is now correctly removed from the Layers tab for images whose original base images were overridden.

tt:[34.02.133]

|*Node crashes on OpenShift 4.18 clusters*

Node crashes may happen on  OpenShift 4.18 clusters in case the defender is configured with a block policy.

This happens because OpenShift 4.18 has changed the default runtime implementation from `runc` to `crun`, and the defender didn't handle that change correctly.

The issue is fixed now.

|*No default outbound access for Azure Agentless Scanning*

Microsoft Azure is retiring the facility to provide default outbound access. See the https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates?id=default-outbound-access-for-vms-in-azure-will-be-retired-transition-to-a-new-method-of-internet-access[Microsoft announcement] for more details. 

This change will adversely impact Prisma Cloud’s ability to perform Agentless Scanning. To mitigate this issue, Prisma Cloud agentless scanners will employ Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway to access the console. 

To enable Prisma Cloud agentless scanners to use the NAT gateway, the following additional permissions have been added to the onboarding Terraform template:

* `Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/read`

* `Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/write`

* `Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/delete`

* `Microsoft.Network/natGateways/read`

* `Microsoft.Network/natGateways/write`

* `Microsoft.Network/natGateways/delete`

This fix ensures that Prisma Cloud Compute uses NAT gateway for agentless scanning.

|*Enhanced AWS resource-level permissions for copying Amazon EBS snapshots*

Amazon AWS has announced enhanced resource-level permissions for copying Amazon EBS snapshots. Please see the https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/enhancing-resource-level-permissions-for-copying-amazon-ebs-snapshots/[Amazon announcement] for more details. This change impacts Prisma Cloud agentless scanning of AWS compute instances.  

To avoid issues that can arise from this change, the following statement has been replaced in the onboarding CFT:

[source,json]
----
"Condition": {
			"StringEquals": {
				"aws:RequestTag/created-by": "prismacloud-agentless-scan"
				}
			},
			"Action": [
				"ec2:CopySnapshot"
			],
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:ec2:*::snapshot/*"
			],
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Sid": "PrismaCloudPrismaCloudAgentlessCopySnapshot8"
		}
----

With this statement:

[source,json]
----
{
			"Condition": {
				"StringEquals": {
					"aws:RequestTag/created-by": "prismacloud-agentless-scan"
				}
			},
			"Action": [

			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:ec2:*::snapshot/snap-*"
			],
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Sid": "PrismaCloudPrismaCloudAgentlessCopySnapshot9"
		}
----

This change ensures that Prisma Cloud uses the enhanced resource-level permissions announced by Amazon AWS.

NOTE: The statement changes won't be shown in the status message as the status check is performed only on the action parameter in the statement; not the other parameters.

|*The "defended" status for ECS task definitions inocorrectly set to `false`*

ECS task definition entities discovered as part of cloud discovery have a "defended" status. This "defended" status field is set to true if a Fargate defender is detected as installed in one of the containers in the task definition. This "defended" status field was incorrectly set to `false` even when a Fargate defender was installed in one of the containers.

This issue is fixed now.


|*RLP-154631*

tt:[Fixed in 25.3.1]

|*Agentless Module Impacts Credit Consumption*

Resolved an issue with Agentless Scanning worker Virtual Machines (VMs) being counted towards Prisma Cloud credit consumption. Previously, credit computation incorrectly included credits attributed to worker VMs. While, the impact to overall credit consumption was negligible, the Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) module now identifies worker VMs spun up by the Agentless module. Consequently, credits attributed to Agentless Scanning worker VMs are no longer included in the credit consumption data that is reported. 

|*CWP-59903*

tt:[Fixed in 34.00.137]

|*Cleanup of system resources after registry scanning*

A new scanner tag is generated when an image is pulled for scanning. In certain cases, this tag was not properly removed after the scan completed.

This issue is fixed now. Improvements to the registry scan mechanism ensure a proper cleanup of system resources after scanning.

| *An incorrect fix date is reported for CVEs that did not provide a fix date initially*

An incorrect fix date is reported for CVEs that did not provide a fix date initially and were then reopened and fixed (again) with a fix date that is later than the date when the issue was first reported as fixed. Prisma Cloud reported the date when the issue was first reported as fixed and did not update the fix date after the issue was reopened and fixed with a different date.           

This issue is fixed now.

The OpenShift version is not available in the RELEASE\_VERSION environment variable in the running 'openshift-tuned' process due to a change in OpenShift. It has now been replaced by a new process called cluster-node-tuning-operator that receives 'openshift-tuned' via command line args. Defenders were unable to detect the OpenShift installation due to this change.  

This issue is fixed now.

| *Fixed RHEL issues are incorrectly flagged as unresolved due to an issue in mapping CPEs to RHEL repositories*

After Redhat switched to the new VEX format for reporting CVEs and fixes, some fixed RHEL issues were incorrectly flagged as unresolved due to an issue in mapping CPEs to RHEL repositories.   

This issue is fixed now.

|*CWP-62570*

tt:[Fixed in 34.00.137]

| *Base images when scanned separately, displayed vulnerabilities that were not present*

The scan results for some base images that were scanned separately incorrectly displayed vulnerabilities–even though no vulnerabilities were present in those base images. Whereas, images using those base images reported the vulnerabilities correctly and did not display any vulnerabilities for the underlying base images.  

This issue is fixed now.

|*CWP-62575*

tt:[Fixed in 34.00.137]

| *False positives observed for vulnerabilities reported in the RedHat VEX format without specific distro-release information*

Vulnerabilities reported in the RedHat VEX format without specific distro-release information generated false positives. 

This issue is fixed now. 


|*CWP-62609*

tt:[Fixed in 34.00.137]

| *Including packages of a Go application that are part of the main module in the scan results*

Previously, Prisma Cloud scan results did not include Go packages that were part of the main module, resulting in the omission of these packages and their associated vulnerabilities in the console. 

This issue has now been resolved.

| *Compliance check 598 always fails for Kubernetes containers running Redis if the container was created without using –requirepass parameter*

Compliance check 598 fails and shows the error “App uses weak or default password” for Kubernetes containers running redis even though the container uses a strong password. This issue occurs if the container was created without using –requirepass parameter.  

This issue is fixed now.

|*CWP-62883*

tt:[Fixed in 34.00.137]

| *The 'fix status' column in the vulnerability report is blank for a few CVEs*

The 'fix status' column in the vulnerability report is blank for a few CVEs due to missing information in the NVD vulnerability feed.  

This issue is fixed now. The required information is now gathered using a separate NVD function.

| *Support Jenkins LTS CVEs detection*

Prisma Cloud now extracts software edition information from CVEs and utilizes it for scanning. This enables Prisma Cloud scanners to differentiate software editions, such as Jenkins LTS releases from regular Jenkins releases, and accurately identify vulnerabilities.


|*CWP-63033*

tt:[Fixed in 34.00.137]

| *Improved Vulnerability Reporting for Mirrored RHEL Repositories*

Repository identifiers often change when repositories are mirrored from Red Hat's Content Delivery Network (CDN) to alternative cloud environments, like AWS. This may result in inaccurate vulnerability reporting. 

The issue has now been resolved by extracting the relative URLs of repositories from the image and comparing them with the corresponding relative URLs provided in the repository-to-CPE mapping file for CVE matching.

tt:[Fixed in 33.03.138]

|*Storage issues during the Defender shutdown process*

The Defender shutdown process in versions 32.02 through 32.05 (inclusive) shut down the storage component using a third-party package. This package used a flag to force storage to unmount during the shutdown, which lead to storage corruption in some cases. This issue was resolved in 32.06 by modifying the shutdown process to perform a non-forced unmount.

For any Defender instance from the affected versions that has already been shut down, upgrade the defender to a non-affected version (32.06 or later) and then reboot the node to clean up any storage corruption.

| *Support for Amazon Linux CVEs*

Previously, Prisma Cloud reported several false positive vulnerabilities for Amazon Linux CVEs that were marked as "not affected" by Amazon.

Prisma Cloud now fully supports CVEs classified as “not affected” by Amazon, improving the accuracy of vulnerability reporting for Amazon products and resolving the false positive issue. The supported Amazon Linux distributions include Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, and Amazon Linux 2023.

NOTE: Prisma Cloud does not support CVEs labeled as "pending fix" or "no fix planned," as Amazon does not provide the required package version details for precise CVE status reporting.

// CWP-61444
|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

| *Improvements in Amazon Linux Vulnerability Reporting*

Vulnerability information for many Amazon Linux CVEs lacked consistency across different Intelligence Stream updates, including changes in severity levels and fixed status versions.
To address this, several key improvements were made, including enhanced consistency across scans, improved handling of duplicated CVEs, accurate ALAS to CVE conversion, and refined kernel package rules. These changes ensure more reliable and actionable vulnerability information for all Amazon distributions and kernel packages.

|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

| *Standardizing Java Versioning for Accurate Vulnerability Mapping*

Inconsistent version numbering for Java products led to several false positives in Prisma Cloud security scans.
To ensure accurate mapping of vulnerabilities to Java versions, all Java product versions will be normalized to the standard 1.x format. For example, in the https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-21930[CVE-2023-21930] entry on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), OpenJDK 8 will map to Java 1.8.

| *Enhanced Detection for Minor Versions in Alpine Packages*

Alpine's security database shows vulnerabilities for each Alpine package, including fixed versions and associated CVEs. However, when the CVE does not include a fixed version, the rule misses vulnerabilities in minor versions, leading to incomplete vulnerability coverage.
This issue has been fixed. The updated vulnerability rules ensure that minor versions are included, even when no specific fixed version is available.

|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

| *CVEs Resolved in Release 33.00*

While alerts were generated for CVE-2024-6104 and CVE-2024-29018, Prisma Cloud was not directly vulnerable and remained safe to use. The alerts have been resolved in Prisma Cloud release 33.00.

// CWP-58073
| tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

| Customers could pass invalid data to the `v1/alert-profile` and `collections` APIs. To address this issue, the following validations have been added:

* For `v1/alert-profiles` APIs:

** The name parameter must be less than 50 characters.
** The email address must be valid.
** The port parameter must not be less than 1.
** The recipient’s email address must be valid.

* For `Collections`:
** The name parameter must be less than 50 characters.
** The description parameter must be less than 200 characters.

// CWP-59190
|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

|*Improved Image Scanning*

If the Defender disconnects while scanning an image that has the same tag, registry, repository, and credentials, it can lead to multiple scan requests of the same image. In addition, a race condition could sometimes prevent the image from being properly removed from the host container registry after scanning.
This fix ensures that only one scan is performed per image, even if multiple scan requests are triggered by disconnections. This reduces the load on the Defender.

The fix also addresses the race condition. However, not all possible race conditions are addressed:

* If the same image is scanned in different repositories or registries, race conditions are not addressed by this fix.
* If the same image is scanned in the same repository and registry but with different tags, the fix does not handle potential race conditions.


// CWP-59443
|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

| Previously, users experienced intermittent timeouts in a shorter timeframe than the default inactivity period, which was set to 300 minutes under *Settings > Enterprise Settings > User Idle Timeout > CX*. This issue has now been resolved, and all Prisma Cloud tabs log out only after 300 minutes of inactivity.

// CWP-59841
|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

| *Agentless Scanning - Support for OCI root compartment scans*

OCI instances deployed in the root compartment were not scanned during Agentless scans. Instances in child compartments were scanned as expected, but root compartment instances were excluded without error. This issue is fixed-all compartments, including the root, are now scanned successfully.


// CWP-60298
|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

|*Compliance IDs 440/441 in Lamba Scans*

Compliance IDs 440/441 triggered false positives during a serverless Lambda scan for kms permissions. This issue is fixed.

// CWP-60356
|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

| *Improved Clarity in Incident Log Messages*

In certain cases, the command that triggered an incident was missing from the incident capture flow. This caused the messages in the Incident Explorer to occasionally lack clarity, leading to incomplete logs.
The fix ensures that executed commands are now included in audit reports when available. Additionally, it prevents the generation of incomplete reports if the command is missing

// CWP-60819
|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

| *Reduced Registry Scan Duration*

Prisma Cloud sometimes experienced extended registry scan times due to certain images not being correctly recognized.
This led to the registry scan missing cached images, resulting in longer scan durations. The cache miss happened because the image ID hash from the Container Runtime API was missing the sha256 prefix.
The issue has now been fixed by using the hash from the registry scan request sent by the Console, when available. This ensures cache hits and enhances scan performance.

// CWP-60900
|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

| Exporting discovered APIs to OpenAPI CSV files from the *Runtime > Monitor > WAAS > API discovery > Export CSV* page failed if the API had unsupported methods such as PURGE. This issue is fixed.

// CWP-61291
|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

| Previously, a "buffer full" error was reported with an HTTP 500 status code, when the same port was reused in a specific order across multiple apps in a single WAAS rule. This issue is fixed now.

//CWP-61362
|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

| Fixed an issue where compliance alerts for malware (Compliance ID 455) did not appear in daily email reports despite failed resources being detected. This fix ensures accurate reporting for agentless scans.

//CWP-61375
|tt:[Fixed in 33.00.169]

|*Agentless Scanning - Resource Group Creation in Target Azure Account during Hub Scan Mode*

Fixed an issue where resource groups were created in the target account during Azure agentless Hub scan mode. Now, resource groups are no longer created in the target account when a hub account is defined on it.

//CWP-61752
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]

|The issue related to interruption in the communication between a defender and the console--that was introduced by the newly introduced fail-safe mechanism aimed to prevent any impact to customer traffic or downtime--is resolved. The fix requires you to upgrade the Console and the Defenders to version 33.00.

//CWP-61027
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|For some GO package CVEs, Prisma Cloud did not completely report all the affected versions, particularly when multiple version ranges were involved, resulting in occasional false negatives.

This issue is fixed. Prisma Cloud now reports all the affected versions for GO package CVEs.

//CWP-61666
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|*Add collections filtering behavior*

Previously, image scan filtering by collection restricted the collections listed in the Collections column to the collection selected in the filter. This issue is fixed now. Now, for each image, all related collections of the filtered images are displayed, even when a specific collection filter is applied.


//CWP-61027
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|When a JAR file with a group ID is used as a dependency in other JAR files within the same image, Prisma Cloud might fail to properly identify or match CVEs to those JAR files. 

This issue is resolved. Prisma Cloud now correctly handles group IDs in both the Defender and the Console, improving the ability to identify CVEs accurately for such JAR files.

//
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|A new optional query parameter `includeLabels` is added to the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cwpp/get-containers-download/[Download Container Scan Results] API. This change will add all the labels corresponding to each container in the API response.

|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Previously, Prisma Cloud did not handle cases involving unaffected and patched Ruby version ranges correctly. Additionally, cases, where patched Ruby version ranges, were included within unaffected Ruby versions using the pessimistic version constraint (~>), those cases were also not handled correctly. This issue has been resolved.

//CWP-57873
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Addressed the issue of false positives during vulnerability assessment  due discrepancies between RPM package names and third-party package names where the same CVE may be listed under different names. For example, `urllib3` for Python versus `python3-urllib3` for RPM. This inconsistency led to potential false positives or missed vulnerabilities. In order to validate if the third-party package should be reported, Prisma Cloud now also assesses the origin package name.

//CWP-51958
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Corrected parsing of Jenkins security information in affected versions and fix versions due to a scheme change. For example, the Jenkins Security Advisory 2021-10-06 did not produce fixed versions, showing all versions as vulnerable  despite CVE-2014-3577 being fixed up to and including version 2.314.

//CWP-57317
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Addressed an issue with Openshift cluster where incorrect image names were fetched for non RPM container images due to the cluster having a generic name for example, openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev To resolve this. The mapping extracts the release and version from image labels and adjusts the name by combining registry, origin name, release, and version to be the image name. For example `<registry>/<image_name>:<version>-<release>`.

//CWP-40044
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Previously, Prisma Cloud skipped scanning Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)-enabled OpenSSL packages to avoid overriding older releases, and instead matched against non-FIPS versions. This led to inaccurate vulnerability reporting.

This issue has been fixed. Prisma Cloud now fully supports scanning FIPS-enabled OpenSSL versions, ensuring correct vulnerability detection and eliminating false positives.

//CWP-49983
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Previously, errors encountered during image scans by Defender were not added to the console log. 

This issue has been fixed. Now, when Defender scans images, error messages are printed to the console log along with the image ID and the name of the Defender.

|Resolved issue causing containerized scans to fail due to long scan data, particularly when encountering large Java dependency lists. You can now conduct scans without encountering this issue.

//CWP-56784
|tt:[Fixed in 32.05]
|With the transition to the CVE 5.0 dataset, NVD has updated the format of rejected CVE descriptions.
Prisma Cloud now seamlessly identifies 'Rejected' and 'Disputed' statuses of CVEs. In NVD the status is *now* labeled as 'Rejected reason', while CVEs tagged as 'Disputed' are identified using http://cve.org/[cve.org] data source, ensuring accurate vulnerability assessment.

//CWP-56788
|tt:[Fixed in 32.05]
|Previously, if modifications were done to a TAS application (such as renaming it), Defender failed to re-scan the application and update the results in the Console. This issue has been resolved. Defender now re-scans the TAS applications whenever changes are made to them.

//CWP-58016

|CVE-2023-6992 impacts the Cloudflare version of the zlib library. However, the zlib library included in Alpine Linux is not affected by this vulnerability. A formal https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/15970[request] has been made to Alpine Linux to classify this CVE as a non-vulnerability for their zlib version. The necessary patch has been merged, and we anticipate its inclusion in the https://secdb.alpinelinux.org[Alpine Linux Security Database] soon.

//CWP-58081
|tt:[Fixed in 32.05]
|Resolved parsing issues in vulnerable package versions.

The fix resolves the following issues related to detection of vulnerable package versions:
