|*ISSUE ID*
|*DESCRIPTION*
//CSPM AND CAS Known Issues

//*RLP-127621*
//Added post-24.1.2, related to PCSUP-20665, retain in KIs list till engg confirms 
//On *Inventory > Assets*, if you filter based on the _Key-Value_ *Asset Tag* and your environment has more that 1 million assets, the results will be inconclusive.
//Contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success representative for more details.

|*RLP-143404*
//Added in 24.6.2

|On some Prisma Cloud stacks, the state of a few alerts generated for *Attack Path* policies was displayed as Open instead of Resolved. This was caused due to an issue, which is now fixed. However, currently the impacted alerts do not display the correct state.

|*RLP-128421*
//Added in 24.4.1

|When you run an RQL query to filter assets associated with the `azure-active-directory-b2c-tenants` API in the Europe region, you may notice that assets listed on the *Investigate* page under *Region Name* incorrectly display as GCP Europe instead of Azure Europe. However, you can safely assume that the asset listed under *Region Name* is Azure Europe instead of GCP Europe.

*Workaround*: To verify the correct region, search for the `location` field in the asset’s JSON.

|*RLP-128421*
//Added in 24.4.1

|When you filter assets associated with the *Azure AD B2C tenants* in the Europe region, you may notice that assets listed on the *Inventory* page under *Region ID* and *Region* columns incorrectly display as GCP Europe instead of Azure Europe. However, you can safely assume that the assets listed under the *Region* and *Region ID* columns are Azure Europe instead of GCP Europe.

*Workaround*: To verify the correct region, search for the `location` field in the asset’s JSON.

|*RLP-133698*
//Added in 24.3.2

|If an Azure account being scanned is of account type Tenant, then Prisma cloud excludes AZURE_MONITOR_ACTIVITY_LOG_ALERT, AZURE_MONITOR_LOG_PROFILE, and ACCOUNT_AGGREGATE_ENTITY asset types from the scan.

|*RLP-129856*
//Added in 24.3.2

|While testing integrations with third-party tools such as Jira, Webhook, Splunk, and Microsoft Teams in Prisma Cloud, "Unsecure url protocol" error may be displayed.

*Workaround*: Update all URLs used during the setup process from *HTTP* to *HTTPS* to resolve the error. This update ensures a more secure connection without impacting your existing alert notifications.

If you do not want to update the URLs from HTTP to HTTPS, you can choose to ignore the error. This will not have any impact on your existing alert notifications.

|*RLP-132750*
//Added in 24.3.2

|The following errors may occur when you onboard your OCI tenant to Prisma Cloud:

* *Either tenant ocid or user ocid or home region is incorrect or insufficient permissions.*
* *Authentication Failed. Check Account Details.*

You can safely ignore these errors. They occur due to the migration of OCI tenants from Oracle Identity Domains (IDCS) to the new OCI IAM on the OCI cloud services, resulting in a significant delay in activating the user API Keys used for OCI Cloud Account Onboarding.

To verify successful onboarding, go to *Settings > Providers > Cloud Accounts* and ensure your account *Status* is *green* after 24 hours.

|*RLP-123335*
//Added in 23.12.1

|When configuring Jira fields in the Prisma Cloud Notification template, it is important to note that the automatic population is limited to fields specifically of types `user` and `labels`. Other field types may not be populated as expected during the setup process. This is a known issue.

|*RLP-113952*
//Added in 24.1.1. Plan is to fix it in 24.5.2. This must be moved to fixed issues then.
|While onboarding your Azure China tenant to Prisma Cloud, you might see an inaccurate warning within the *Review Status > Security Capabilities and Permissions* section, even if you have granted the necessary permissions.

`Prisma Cloud application is not assigned following role(s): GroupMember.Read.All, Domain.Read.All, Reports.Read.All, Application.Read.All, Policy.Read.All;`

This is a known issue and can be disregarded. This will be fixed in the upcoming release.

|*RLP-104295*
//Added in 23.7.2. 
|Prisma Cloud has fully adopted Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for monitoring Azure instances. However, in very rare cases, you might come across log entries for calls from Prisma Cloud to Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) endpoints. These entries can be disregarded. A fix will be implemented to resolve these erroneous entries.


|*RLP-90184*
//Raised in 23.2.1

|The behavior of filters on the *Alerts Overview* page is slightly different from that on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages. On the *Alerts Overview* page when you select the `Asset Class`, `Resource Type`, and `Service Name` filters, the alerts displayed are a combination of those three selected filters. Whereas on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages, the preference is given to `Resource Type` over `Service Name` when both those filters are selected due to which the assets for which alerts are displayed on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages do not match those displayed on the *Alerts Overview* page.


|*RLP-78777*
//Blurb shared by Arun

|The AWS Global Accelerator service returns an Access Denied error with the error assumed-role/PrismaCloudReadOnlyRole/redlock is not authorized to perform: iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole on resource. The issue occurs because the `aws-global-accelerator-accelerator`` API requires you to enable the service-linked IAM role to ingest metadata. To resolve the error, add the role to include the required permissions.

*Workaround*: If you do not want to enable the service-linked role, create a support ticket with Palo Alto Networks Technical Support to disable the AWS Global Accelerator service API.


|*RLP-73807*
|In Unified Asset Inventory, Compute alerts are not displayed in the Resource Explorer audit trail.


|*RLP-72605*
|The list of alert counts that correspond to a policy are inaccurate when you select more than one alert rule name. This issue is seen on:

* The *Alerts > Overview*, when you select multiple Alert Rule Names in the filter, the results for the number of alerts that correspond to a policy is not accurate. The Alert Rule Filter works as expected when you select only one Alert Rule Name.

* When you use the `POST/alerts/policy` API, make sure to include only one Alert Rule Name for the `filters` attribute in the request body schema.


|*RLP-75376*
|*PCDS Azure only—* If you have enabled public access from selected IP addresses on storage account with Prisma Cloud NAT IPs and Azure outbound IPs added to the allow list, ingestion fails with 403 error (permission denied).


|*RLP-65612*
|*PCDS Azure only—* The *Inventory* page may display 400 error if data is not available.


|*RLP-65602*
|*PCDS Azure only—* During onboarding when you enter the *Client ID* and *Secret*, if the Secret exceeds the specified length, a bad request error displays.


|*RLP-68751*
|In Unified Asset Inventory, only System Administrators can view the Compute assets and not other users. Compute alerts will not be accessible on Alerts pages for all users except System Administrators.


|*RLP-65286*
//PCSUP-8439
|When integrating Prisma Cloud with Jira, if the Jira `issueType` field uses space as a separator between the words, such as `Service Request` or `New Feature` , a 500 Internal Server error occurs while configuring Typeahead fields such as Reporter or Assignee, in a Notification Template. You will be unable to create a Notification Template for Jira with the Typeahead fields.

*Workaround*: Rename the field to remove the space or add an underscore. For example, `ServiceRequest` or `New_Feature`. You can then add Typeahead fields in a Notification Template.


|*RLP-65216*
//RLP-70084, PCSUP-8587
|If you have configured multiple flow logs for a VPC and if any of the flow logs are incorrectly configured, the flow log status on Prisma Cloud is reported as a warning (Amber). This status does not impact ingestion for all the correctly configured flow logs.


|*RLP-62558*
//Raised in 23.1.2
|The resource name displayed on the Alerts L2 page does not match the name displayed for the same resource on the Asset Explorer page.


|*RLP-60005*
|Prisma Cloud may not process some of the delete bucket events, due to which the buckets that you have deleted in the AWS console will be visible in the Prisma Cloud *Inventory* page.


//*RLP-59655* - Removing per confirmation from Shital Katkar
//Prisma Cloud supports user attribution, but there may be some delay when generating user attribution for an alert, even when *Settings > Enterprise Settings > Alerts User Attribution* is enabled.


//*RLP-58180* - Removing this as a Known Issue per the ticket, marked as fixed.
//Added for PCSUP-7729 in 22.2.1.
//On *Inventory > Assets*, OKE clusters (Oracle Kubernetes Engine) deployed in Santiago region do not display. You can view resources for other https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/cloud-service-provider-regions-on-prisma-cloud.html[supported regions].


//*RLP-57331* - Removing this as a Known Issue per the ticket.
//The *Compute* tab displays with a provisioning message for Business Edition license on the Prisma Cloud administrative console. The Compute tab should not display for the Business Edition license.


//*RLP-55763* - Removing this as a Known Issue per the ticket.
//This fix may trigger alerts to be opened or closed as applicable.


|*RLP-55036*
|When changing the *Maximum time before access keys expire* value for access keys, it may take up to 15 minutes for the updates to take effect.


//*RLP-53374*
//PCSUP-6358 - Removed per confirmation from Santosh Kadli
//On occasion, alerts generated against Network Policies can be less accurate when the policy includes the RQL attribute *dest.resource IN (resource where role*.

//In these cases, a policy match occurs because the resource such as a web server, ELB, or NAT Gateway either may not have been classified by the engine yet or the classification is no longer applicable when flow logs are analyzed to detect a violation. In such instances, you have to triage and close the alert manually.


|*RLP-40248*
//Open to review of this text.
|When you create an alert rule and specify target resource tags, Prisma Cloud processes only a single resource tag key/value pair properly. Proper processing of multiple resource tags or resource tags with multiple values is not guaranteed. This behavior exists whether you create the alert rule through the Prisma Cloud console or through the CSPM API.


|*RLP-27427* 
|*Applies to Prisma Cloud Data Security only*

Malware report is not available in PDF format.


|*RLP-25117*
//marked as moving too v2 since it's not a must fix
|*Applies to Prisma Cloud Data Security only*
The Dashboard displays an error when you select an account group that does not contain any accounts.


|*RLP-19480*
|The Business Unit Report does not support multi-byte characters used in languages such as Japanese.


|*RLP-19470*
|The Business Unit Report csv file lists all enabled policies even when there are no open alerts, because there are no resources to scan.


|*RLP-14469*
//Marked as won't fix.
|When you enable Dataflow compression for a cloud account, the subnetwork creation status may display a failure message on the onboarding status page. This error displays because the time threshold to create the subnetwork and report completion exceeds the response time threshold on Prisma Cloud.

*Workaround—* Click to the previous page and click next to load the status page again.


|*RLP-13485*
|If you have the maximum number of VPCs (5) already created in the project and you then enable flowlog compression, the onboarding fails because Prisma Cloud is unable to add the network needed to enable Dataflow compression. When this happens the remediation steps in the message that displays is incorrect.


|*RLP-9723* 
|The integration status check for Jira displays as yellow instead of red even if the integration is misconfigured.


|*—* 
// *July 2018*
|Dashboard widgets don't load for a large data set where the time window is also large.


|*—* 
|The `aws-ecs-describe-task-definition` and `aws-emr-describe-cluster` APIs now run once every 24 hours to generate alerts. If you have cloud accounts with a significant amount of ECS/EMR resources, the resource status is updated once a day.


|*—* 
//PCSUP-13188
|The configuration build policies are displayed even if you have not enabled Code Security module.


|*—*
//PCSUP-13468
|Currently when you edit default policies in the Code Security module, the policy is duplicated with the updated metadata. Both the unedited policy and the edited policy are then visible on *Projects* when the *Status- Suppressed* (for the original policy) and *Errors* (for the edited policy) are enabled.



|*—*
//PCSUP-6369, 7878. Need to track this and mark it as fixed.

|AWS CloudTrail in the Osaka region (ap-northeast-3) do not display on the Prisma Cloud administrative console.

This issue requires a fix on AWS. When fixed on AWS, the issue will be automatically resolved on Prisma Cloud.

//CWP-52736
 
|In 31.02.133, the new 81 out-of-box admission control rules in Rego are not available by default. This issue is targeted to be addressed in the next release (32.00.xxx).

|*—* 
//*Inconsistent reporting of AKS cluster names and type*
//CWP-50923
|AKS clusters with an underscore "_" in the resource group name are detected as vanilla Kubernetes clusters instead of AKS clusters in the host scan results.

|*PCSUP-11309*
//added Kepler Update 2
|The `--tarball`` option in twistcli does not scan for compliance checks. Currently, only vulnerabilities are detected successfully.

|*—* 
// #22837
|Windows hosts running Defender are reported as unprotected. This issue occurs when Defender is installed on Windows hosts in AWS and Cloud Discovery is configured to scan your environment for protected hosts.


|*—* 
//25757
|If you have the same custom compliance rule in use in a host policy (effect: alert) and a container policy (effect: block), the rules will enforce your policy (as expected), but the audit message for a blocked container will incorrectly refer to the host policy and host rule name.


|*—* 
// #35634/35308
|On the *Radar > Containers*, K3s clusters are not displayed when a Defender is deployed with an empty cluster name. You can view the containers within these clusters under *Non-cluster containers*.

|*—* 
// GH#42826
|A `404 Not Found error` is displayed when performing a sandbox image analysis using older version of twistcli, such as v22.06, with the 22.12 console.

|*PCSUP-22448*
//CWP-58172, CWP-45452
|DNS audit does not work on AWS app-embedded Fargate Defender. Also, DNS audit works only *Alpine* image and not on any other OS, such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Redhat.

|*PCSUP-12197*
// CWP-41449
|For an application that originates from an OS package, the vulnerability data for CVEs is sourced from the relevant feed for the OS package. In some cases, like with Amazon Linux and Photon OS, this CVE information is provided in security advisories such as Amazon Linux Security Advisories (ALAS) for Amazon, and PHSA for Photon. In such cases, the correlation for the relevant vulnerabilities is limited.

As an example, when the application “python” is sourced from an Amazon Python package, CVEs found for the python application (as a binary) will not be correlated with the relevant Amazon CVEs from the ALAS.

|Compliance check 6361 fails for hosts running RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.
The check to ensure the `iptables` package is installed fails because `iptables` was deprecated in RHEL 9 and replaced with the `nftables` package.

//CWP-53375
|*-*
|In **Inventory > Compute Workloads**, for users logged in with a role other than the built in system admin role, currently only data about cloud provider managed registry images and VM instances can be viewed.
In particular, for such roles currently data about the following types of assets is not displayed:

- Run stage images
- Private registry images
- Build stage images
- On-premises hosts/hosts managed by cloud providers unsupported by Compute

//CWP-58896
|*CWP-58896*
|* With the support for ACI in cloud discovery, here are the two issues:

** Status: The `status` field currently utilizes Properties > ProvisioningState, which does not reflect the container status. For more information, refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-state[Azure Container Instances states].

** Defend: The Defend functionality does not support Azure Container Instances (ACI). The Defend is enabled across all accounts and services, and when selected, it redirects to Images > Registry Settings.

|*CWP-58709*
|*Duplicate Admission Rules*

Six admission rules released in Version 32, Update 2 were found to be duplicates of older existing rules. If you need the functionality provided by these rules, we recommend disabling the old rules and using the new corresponding rules, as the older rules will be removed in an upcoming release.

The old rules and their corresponding new rules are as follows:

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - CIS - Pod created in host process ID namespace. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Baseline - Pod with containers that share host process ID (hostPID) namespace

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - CIS - Pod created on host IPC namespace. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Baseline - Pod with containers that share host IPC namespace

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - CIS - Pod created on host network. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Baseline - Pod that allows containers to share the host network namespace

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - Pod created with sensitive host file system mount. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Baseline - Pod created with sensitive host file system mount

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - CIS - Privileged pod created. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Baseline - Pod should not run privileged containers

* *Old rule*: Twistlock Labs - CIS - Privilege escalation pod created. *New rule*: Twistlock Labs - PSS - Restricted - Pod that allows container privilege escalation

Note: Even though both the new and old rules are enabled by default, you will not receive duplicate alerts as only the first encountered rule is enforced.

|*CWP-58350*
|*CVE Exclusions Update*

The following CVEs that are included in the Intelligence Stream feed are ignored:
CVE-2022-29583 - GitHub Advisory Database as it is a disputed vulnerability.
CVE-2024-3154 - Arbitrary Systemd Property Injection as Defender does not directly use this package.

|*CWP-52710*
|While upgrading consoles from the 30.03 release to a 32.xx release, the error log `failed to retrieve "size" specification option value` during the migration doesn't impact the migration process and can be ignored.

// |*CWP-59104*
// |A flaw in the https://github.com/containers/image[GitHub - containers/image: Work with containers' images] library, CVE-2024-3727 (HIGH severity) “allows attackers to trigger unexpected authenticated registry accesses on behalf of a victim user, causing resource exhaustion, local path traversal, and other attacks.” To exploit this flaw, the attacker should be able to upload malicious images to the registry and persuade a victim to pull them.
// This container's image library is used in registry scanning use cases and is a fundamental building block of the registry scanning process. This issue will be resolved in a maintenance window that is currently scheduled for 9th June 2024.

|*ISSUE ID*
|*DESCRIPTION*

//
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|A new optional query parameter `includeLabels` is added to the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cwpp/get-containers-download/[Download Container Scan Results] API. This change will add all the labels corresponding to each container in the API response.

//
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Previously, Prisma Cloud did not handle cases involving unaffected and patched Ruby version ranges correctly. Additionally, cases, where patched Ruby version ranges, were included within unaffected Ruby versions using the pessimistic version constraint (~>), those cases were also not handled correctly. This issue has been resolved.

//CWP-57873
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Addressed the issue of false positives during vulnerability assessment  due discrepancies between RPM package names and third-party package names where the same CVE may be listed under different names. For example, `urllib3` for Python versus `python3-urllib3` for RPM. This inconsistency led to potential false positives or missed vulnerabilities. In order to validate if the third-party package should be reported, Prisma Cloud now also assesses the origin package name.

//CWP-51958
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Corrected parsing of Jenkins security information in affected versions and fix versions due to a scheme change. For example, the Jenkins Security Advisory 2021-10-06 did not produce fixed versions, showing all versions as vulnerable  despite CVE-2014-3577 being fixed up to and including version 2.314.

//CWP-57317
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Addressed an issue with Openshift cluster where incorrect image names were fetched for non RPM container images due to the cluster having a generic name for example, openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev To resolve this. The mapping extracts the release and version from image labels and adjusts the name by combining registry, origin name, release, and version to be the image name. For example `<registry>/<image_name>:<version>-<release>`.

//CWP-40044
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Previously, Prisma Cloud skipped scanning Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)-enabled OpenSSL packages to avoid overriding older releases, and instead matched against non-FIPS versions. This led to inaccurate vulnerability reporting.

This issue has been fixed. Prisma Cloud now fully supports scanning FIPS-enabled OpenSSL versions, ensuring correct vulnerability detection and eliminating false positives.

//CWP-49983
|tt:[Fixed in 32.07]
|Previously, errors encountered during image scans by Defender were not added to the console log. 

This issue has been fixed. Now, when Defender scans images, error messages are printed to the console log along with the image ID and the name of the Defender.

//RLP-132008
//tt:[Fixed in 24.6.1]
//Fixed an issue where deleted assets were getting included in vulnerability searches.

//RLP-141312
//tt:[Fixed in 24.5.2]
//Fixed an issue that was causing an increased time-to-alert (TTA) for few function-based Aggregate or Join policies where major resources had not been recently updated. 
//The fix may cause a relatively higher number of alerts being generated for such policies shortly after deployment.

//CWP-56554
|tt:[Fixed in 32.05]
|Resolved issue causing containerized scans to fail due to long scan data, particularly when encountering large Java dependency lists. You can now conduct scans without encountering this issue.

//CWP-56784
|tt:[Fixed in 32.05]
|With the transition to the CVE 5.0 dataset, NVD has updated the format of rejected CVE descriptions.
Prisma Cloud now seamlessly identifies 'Rejected' and 'Disputed' statuses of CVEs. In NVD the status is *now* labeled as 'Rejected reason', while CVEs tagged as 'Disputed' are identified using http://cve.org/[cve.org] data source, ensuring accurate vulnerability assessment.

//CWP-56788
|tt:[Fixed in 32.05]
|Previously, if modifications were done to a TAS application (such as renaming it), Defender failed to re-scan the application and update the results in the Console. This issue has been resolved. Defender now re-scans the TAS applications whenever changes are made to them.

//CWP-58016
|tt:[Fixed in 32.05]
|Fix an issue where “risk factor” field was missed on Function and Host CSV results.

//CWP-56786
|tt:[Fixed in 32.05]
|CVE-2023-6992 impacts the Cloudflare version of the zlib library. However, the zlib library included in Alpine Linux is not affected by this vulnerability. A formal https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/15970[request] has been made to Alpine Linux to classify this CVE as a non-vulnerability for their zlib version. The necessary patch has been merged, and we anticipate its inclusion in the https://secdb.alpinelinux.org[Alpine Linux Security Database] soon.

//CWP-58081
|tt:[Fixed in 32.05]
|Resolved parsing issues in vulnerable package versions.

The fix resolves the following issues related to detection of vulnerable package versions: 

* Correct parsing of vulnerable package versions.
* Parsing of version ranges with different prefixes.
* Handling of conditions for multiple versions to ensure they are added to the Intelligence feed. This resolves both false negative and false positive alerts.

//CWP-57215 and CWP-57235(cloned doc ticket)
|tt:[Fixed in 32.04]
|Vulnerabilities identified as GHSA-xm99-6pv5-q363, also known as CVE-2022-29583, are now suppressed in Defender and Console images since they are disputed.

//CWP-56697
//Added this as per Manu's conversation with Orit.
|tt:[Fixed in 32.04]
|Fixed the error that blocked downloading of the serverless defender bundle for Azure C# functions.

//CWP-56294
|tt:[Fixed in 32.04]
|Added the `incidentTime` macro for webhook alerts. The macro shows the time the incident occurred. For example, `Jan 21, 2018 UTC`.

//CWP-56818
|tt:[Fixed in 32.04]
|Previously, node count was not appearing for EKS clusters on *Manage > Cloud accounts* as a part of *Discovery* report. This is now addressed, and the accurate node count is displayed both on the Prisma Cloud console and in https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cwpp/get-cloud-discovery/[API Cloud Discovery scan results].

//CWP-56589
|tt:[Fixed in 32.04]
|Resolved the issue where container images scanned with twistcli did not appear on the *Runtime Security > Inventory > Assets* and the *Cloud Security > Inventory > Compute Workloads* pages.
