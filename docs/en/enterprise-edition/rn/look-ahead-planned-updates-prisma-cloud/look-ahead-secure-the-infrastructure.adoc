* Optimize Resources: This change helps allocate resources more effectively, allowing the Prisma Cloud team to work on more feature improvements for you.

*Impact—* Prisma Cloud will release new features, enhancements, and security updates on a monthly basis starting in October 2024 (no more .2 releases). Each release will be accompanied by detailed release notes to keep you informed of what's new.

If you have any questions or feedback, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Support representative.

//Thank You for your support and we appreciate your understanding and support as we make this transition. Our goal is to provide you with the best possible product and experience. If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out to our support team.

|*Audit Logs Retention Period*
//RLP-146965, RLP-147876

|Starting with the 24.9.2 release, the Audit logs from AWS, Azure, GCP Cloud providers, and Prisma Cloud are purged from the live system after 120 days or when the total number of logs exceeds 1.2 billion, whichever comes first. Once the logs are purged, they are no longer accessible via RQL queries on the Investigate page in Prisma Cloud. However, the data on the logs are retained in an archived, encrypted format for the duration of your contract. To retrieve any purged data, you must contact your Customer Success Representative. 

*Impact—* Once the logs are purged, they will not be accessible via RQL queries on the *Investigate* page in Prisma Cloud. However, the data on the logs will be retained in an archived, encrypted format for the duration of your contract. 

To retrieve any purged data, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.9.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.
