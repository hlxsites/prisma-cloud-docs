=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

// |*Tag-based Resource Lists*
//RLP-140177

// |Starting with the X release, the following limits will be enforced for Tag-based Resource Lists:

//* Tag-based Resource Lists will be limited to 10 key-value pairs
//* Up to 5 Tag-based Resource Lists may be associated with a Role

//*Impact*: These changes will affect Tag-based Resource Lists and Roles after the X release. Existing configurations will not be affected.
// Commenting out per feedback from AO 5/24 - check for 6.2 inclusion

|*New Limits for Audit Log API*
//RLP-142211

|Prisma Cloud will introduce a response size limit of 100K records for the Audit Logs endpoint effective 24.7.1.

* https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/rl-audit-logs/[GET - /audit/redlock]


|*API Rate Limits — Update User Role API*
//RLP-141323

|To resolve a critical performance issue with the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/update-user-role/[Update User Role] API (PUT /user/role), a rate limit with the following parameters will be implemented effective 24.6.2.

`Limit=3, Burst=3` 

*Impact*—Requests exceeding these limits will result in an *HTTP 429* Too Many Requests response.

|*Role-Based Access Control for Compliance and Alert Reports*
//RLP-140182

|User-generated reports will only be visible to System Administrators and to users with the same role effective 24.8.1.

Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enhances data security by streamlining report access for users with the same role, while also preventing unauthorized access.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.6.2.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

//|*Policies*
//|*Description*

//|*Azure Application Gateway WAF policy is not enabled in prevention mode*
//RLP-141038

//|This policy identifies the Azure Application Gateway WAF policies that are not enabled in prevention mode.

//Azure Application Gateway WAF policies support Prevention and Detection modes. Detection mode monitors and logs all threat alerts to a log file. Detection mode is useful for testing purposes and configures WAF initially but it does not provide protection. It logs the traffic, but it doesn't take any actions such as allow or deny. Where as, in Prevention mode, WAF analyzes incoming traffic to the application gateway and blocks any requests that are determined to be malicious based on a set of rules.

//As a best security practice, it is recommended to enable Application Gateway WAF policies with Prevention mode to prevent malicious requests from reaching your application and potentially causing damage.

//*Policy Severity—* Low

//*Policy Type—* Config

//----
//config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-application-gateway-waf-policy' AND json.rule = properties.applicationGateways[*].id size greater than 0 and properties.policySettings.state equal ignore case Enabled and properties.policySettings.mode does not equal ignore case Prevention
//----

//|*Azure Storage Account storing Cognitive service diagnostic logs is publicly accessible*
//RLP-141884

//| This policy identifies Azure Storage Accounts storing Cognitive service diagnostic logs are publicly accessible. 

//Azure Storage account stores Cognitive service diagnostic logs which might contain detailed information of platform logs, resource logs, trace logs and metrics. Diagnostic log data may contain sensitive data and helps in identifying potentially malicious activity. The attacker could exploit publicly accessible storage account to get cognitive diagnostic data logs and could breach in to the system by leveraging data exposed and propagate across your system.

//As a best security practice, it is recommended to restrict storage account access to only to the services as per business requirement.

//*Policy Severity—* Medium

//*Policy Type—* Config

//----
//config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-cognitive-services-account-diagnostic-settings' AND json.rule = (properties.logs[?any(enabled equal ignore case "true")] exists or properties.metrics[?any( enabled equal ignore case "true" )] exists) and properties.storageAccountId exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = 'totalPublicContainers > 0 and (properties.allowBlobPublicAccess is true or properties.allowBlobPublicAccess does not exist)' as Y; filter '$.X.properties.storageAccountId contains $.Y.id'; show Y;
//----

// |*Azure Key vault used for machine learning workspace secrets storage is not enabled with audit logging*
//RLP-142008

// |This policy identifies Azure Key vaults used for machine learning workspace secrets storage that are not enabled with audit logging.

//Azure Key vaults are used to store machine learning workspace secrets and other sensitive information that is needed by the workspace. Enabling key vaults with audit logging will help in monitoring how and when machine learning workspace secrets are accessed, and by whom. This audit log data enhances visibility by providing valuable insights into the trail of interactions involving confidential information.

//As a best practice,  it is recommended to enable audit event logging for key vaults used for machine learning workspace secrets storage.

//*Policy Severity—* Informational

//*Policy Type—* Config

//----
//config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-machine-learning-workspace' AND json.rule = properties.keyVault exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-key-vault-list' AND json.rule =  "not (diagnosticSettings.value[*].properties.logs[*].enabled any equal true and diagnosticSettings.value[*].properties.logs[*].enabled size greater than 0)" as Y; filter '$.X.properties.keyVault contains $.Y.name'; show Y; 
//----

// |*OCI VCN subnet flow logging is disabled*
//RLP-61034

// |This policy identifies Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) subnets that have flow logs disabled. 

//Enabling VCN flow logs enables you to monitor traffic flowing within your virtual network and can be used to detect anomalous traffic. Without the flow logs turned on, it is not possible to get any visibility into network traffic. 

//It is recommended to enable a VCN flow log on each of your VCN subnets

//*Policy Severity—* Low

//*Policy Type—* Config

//----
//config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'oci-networking-subnet' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'oci-logging-logs' AND json.rule = lifecycleState equals ACTIVE and isEnabled is true and configuration.source.service contains flowlogs as Y; filter 'not ($.X.id contains $.Y.configuration.source.resource)'; show X;

//RLP-142340

|NA
|24.10.1
|`gcloud-cloud-function-v1` API is planned for deprecation. Due to this change, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest metadata for `gcloud-cloud-function-v1 API`. 

In RQL, the key will not be available in the api.name attribute auto-completion. As a replacement, it is recommended to use the `gcloud-cloud-function-v2` API.

*Impact*—If you have a saved search or custom policies based on this API, you must delete those manually. The policy alerts will be resolved as Policy_Deleted.

|To provide better performance, the *Compliance trendline* will start displaying data only from the past one year. Prisma Cloud will not retain the snapshots of data older than one year.
The Compliance-related filters (*Compliance Requirement, Compliance Standard, and Compliance Section*) will not be available on Asset Inventory (*Inventory > Assets*).

|The following endpoints are deprecated as the date filters—time object or time string in query parameters or the request body—used by these APIs will be removed in the updated API endpoints. The updated API endpoints will always return current data.
