[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*


|*Audit Logs Pagination and Filter*
//RLP-151119

|Starting with the 24.11.1 release, the Audit Logs will include enhancements to improve performance, reduce data load times, and provide more granular control over data retrieval:

* The Audit Logs page will display paginated data, which will enhance navigation through extensive logs and the filtering options will provide you with more control over your log data. 

* You will also be able to use the new API to programatically leverage the new pagination and filter capabilities to streamline your use cases. 

|*Governance Dashboard and Policy Endpoint Updates*
//RLP-150508

|Starting with the 24.11.1 release, a new filter option for *Asset Type* will be added to the *Governance* page. This will allow users to filter the policy list based on the type of asset associated with the policy.

The *GET /v2/policy* endpoint will have a new query parameter `resource.type` to enable filtering the policy list by asset type. The response will also include the `resource.type` to indicate the Asset Type associated with each returned policy.

The CSV download from the *Governance* page will also include a new column *Asset Type*.


// |*RQL API Rate Limits* 
//to create RLP

// |Starting with the 24.12.1 release, to improve the user experience, a response size limit of 100K records is now implemented for the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/rl-audit-logs/[GET - /audit/redlock] Audit Logs endpoint.

// *Impact—* Requests exceeding 100K records limit results in a *413 Payload Too Large* error with _X-Record-Count_ header, which indicates the number of records that were being requested.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.11.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.


[#policy-updates]
=== Policy Updates

[cols="35%a,65%a"]
|===
|*Policy Updates*
|*Description*

|*Azure Logic App configured with public network access*
//RLP-150603

|RQL will be updated to avoid false positives in case the Logic App has public access disabled using default behavior with a private endpoint configured.

*Current RQL*: 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = 'properties.state equal ignore case running and kind contains workflowapp and ((properties.publicNetworkAccess exists and properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled) or (properties.publicNetworkAccess does not exist)) and config.ipSecurityRestrictions[?any((action equals Allow and ipAddress equals Any) or (action equals Allow and ipAddress equals 0.0.0.0/0))] exists'
----

*Proposed RQL*:
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = 'properties.state equal ignore case running and kind contains workflowapp and ((properties.publicNetworkAccess exists and properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled) or (properties.publicNetworkAccess does not exist and (properties.privateLinkIdentifiers does not exist or properties.privateLinkIdentifiers is empty))) and config.ipSecurityRestrictions[?any((action equals Allow and ipAddress equals Any) or (action equals Allow and ipAddress equals 0.0.0.0/0))] exists'
----

*Policy Type*: Config

*Policy Severity*: Medium

*Alert Impact*: Low

*Impact*: Open alerts on the Logic App have public access disabled using default behavior with a private endpoint configured will be resolved.


|*GCP SQL Instances do not have valid SSL configuration*
//RLP-150532

|*Current Policy Description*:

This policy identifies GCP SQL instances that do not have valid SSL configuration with an unexpired SSL certificate. Cloud SQL supports connecting to an instance using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If Cloud SQL Auth proxy is not used for authentication, it is recommended to utilize SSL for connection to SQL Instance, ensuring the security for data in transit.

*Proposed Policy Description*:

This policy identifies GCP SQL instances that do not have valid SSL configuration with an expired SSL certificate. 

In case the SQL instance is not configured to use the SSL connections then the SQL instance might accept unencrypted and unsecure connections. This can cause several risks and issues such as Data Interception, Authentication Risks and so on. 

It is a best practice to enable SSL configuration to ensure data security and integrity when communicating with a GCP SQL instance.

*Current Policy RQL*:
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-sql-instances-list' and json.rule = "(settings.ipConfiguration.requireSsl is true and _DateTime.ageInDays(serverCaCert.expirationTime) > -1) or not (settings.ipConfiguration.requireSsl is true)"
----
*Proposed Policy RQL*:
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-sql-instances-list' and json.rule = "(settings.ipConfiguration.sslMode equal ignore case TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED and _DateTime.ageInDays(serverCaCert.expirationTime) > -1) or settings.ipConfiguration.sslMode equal ignore case ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED"
----
*Current Policy Remediation*:

Reference Google's https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ssl-instance[documentation] to renew / update the SSL certificate.  

*Proposed policy Remediation*:

To configure SQL instance with SSL configuration,follow the steps mentioned below:

. Log in to google cloud console
. Navigate to 'Cloud SQL Instances'
. Click on the alerted instance and navigate to 'Security' under 'Connections' tab
. Select one of the following under 'Manage SSL mode':
.. Allow only SSL connections
.. Require trusted client certificates

To verify the validity of the current certificate, follow the steps mentioned below:

. Log in to google cloud console
. Navigate to 'Cloud SQL Instances'
. Click on the alerted instance and navigate to 'Security' under 'Connections' tab
. Verify the expiration date of your server certificate under 'Manage server CA certificates' table

Review these https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ssl-instance#client-certs[steps] to create a new client certificate. 

*Policy Type*: Config

*Policy Severity*: Low

*Impact*: 

Low. Alerts will be triggered in case the SQL instance is configured with SSL mode as ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED or TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED with expired certificate

Open Alerts will be resolved in case the SQL instance is configured with SSL mode as ENCRYPTED_ONLY or TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED with valid certificate.
