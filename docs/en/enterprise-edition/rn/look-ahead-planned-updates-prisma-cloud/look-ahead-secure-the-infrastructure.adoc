[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*


|*API Rate Limits*

//RLP-129569

|Prisma Cloud uses API https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/rate-limits/[rate limits] at the endpoint level to protect the performance and availability of its services. Rate limits will be applied to additional APIs starting from the 24.5.2 release. Details of these rate limits will be made available in the supporting API documentation and Look Ahead Notices when these limits are introduced. 


|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*

tt:[This change was first announced in the look ahead that was published with the 23.1.1 release.]
//RLP-76433 - verify with PM moving blurb from LA to 24.3.1 RN

|If you currently ingest AWS flow logs using S3 with the 24-hour partition, you need to change it to the hourly partition.

To make this change, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-aws/configure-flow-logs[Configure Flow Logs] to use the hourly partition and enable the required additional fields.

*Impact*— VPC Flow logs with partitions set to *Every 24 hours (default)* will be disabled on February 29th, 2024. As a result, you will no longer be able to monitor or receive alerts for these logs. If you have any questions, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative immediately.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents rrent Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.3.2.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|*Policy Updates*
|*Description*

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*


|tt:[Update] *Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud set to Off for DNS*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-130970

|*Changes—* The Policy RQL has been updated to check either of the config i.e, Azure Microsoft Defender for servers plan 2 (which includes DNS) has not been enabled or Azure Microsoft Classic Defender for Cloud which has defender setting for DNS set to Off 

*Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-security-center-settings' AND json.rule = pricings[?any(name equals Dns and properties.pricingTier does not equal Standard)] exists
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-security-center-settings' AND json.rule = pricings[?any(name equals VirtualMachines and properties.pricingTier equal ignore case Standard and properties.subPlan equal ignore case P2)] does not exist or pricings[?any(name equals Dns and properties.pricingTier does not equal Standard)] exists
----

*Impact—* Low. New Alerts might be generated in case the Azure Microsoft Defender for servers plan 2 is not enabled or Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud which has defender setting for DNS set to Off. Existing alerts might get resolved in case Azure Microsoft Classic Defender for servers plan 2 is enabled.


|tt:[Update] *AWS SQS queue access policy is overly permissive*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-130581

|*Changes—* Policy RQL has been updated to consider Action: SQS* as the IAM action and prefix are case-insensitive.

*Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-sqs-get-queue-attributes' AND json.rule = attributes.Policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and Action anyStartWith sqs: and (Principal.AWS contains * or Principal equals *) and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-sqs-get-queue-attributes' AND json.rule = attributes.Policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Action anyStartWith sqs: or Action anyStartWith SQS:) and (Principal.AWS contains * or Principal equals *) and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

*Impact—* Low. New Alerts might be generated in case the IAM action starts with SQS*


|tt:[Update] *GCP Storage buckets are publicly accessible to all users*

tt:[*24.3.2*]

//RLP-128109

|*Changes—* Policy RQL will be updated to account for bucket level prevent public access feature. The recommendation is also updated as per the updated GCP UI.

*Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-storage-buckets-list' AND json.rule = 'iam.bindings[*] size greater than 0 and iam.bindings[*].members[*] any equal allUsers'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-storage-buckets-list' AND json.rule = iamConfiguration.publicAccessPrevention does not equal ignore case "enforced" and iam.bindings[*] size greater than 0 and iam.bindings[*].members[*] any equal allUsers'
----

*Impact—* Low. Existing alerts on buckets with the prevent public access feature enabled at the bucket level will be resolved. Alerts will be generated against the policy violations.
