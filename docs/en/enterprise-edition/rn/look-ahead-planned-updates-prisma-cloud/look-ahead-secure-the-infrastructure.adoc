[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

To learn about the upcoming new Prisma Cloud policies and updates to existing Prisma Cloud policies, you need access to the *private* Prisma Cloud policies repository on GitHub. The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. 

Contact your Prisma Cloud representative, who will let you know the information required to get access to the repository. Once you receive access to the Prisma Cloud policies repository:

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has a monthly release, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<1>. For example, PCS-25.7.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

*Azure SQL server public network access setting is enabled*
//RLP-156277

|*Changes–* The policy description and remediation steps will be updated to reflect the latest changes in Azure to ensure accurate remediation of flagged resources.

*Current Description–*

This policy identifies Azure SQL servers which have public network access setting enabled. Publicly accessible SQL servers are vulnerable to external threats with risk of unauthorized access or may remotely exploit any vulnerabilities. It is recommended to configure the SQL servers with IP-based strict server-level firewall rules or virtual-network rules or private endpoints so that servers are accessible only to restricted entities.

*Updated Description–*

This policy identifies Azure SQL servers which have public network access setting enabled. Publicly accessible SQL servers are vulnerable to external threats with risk of unauthorized access or may remotely exploit any vulnerabilities. It is recommended to disable public network access to the Azure SQL servers and use private endpoints or virtual network service endpoints to secure connectivity.
