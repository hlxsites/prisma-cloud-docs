[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has a monthly release, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-25.2.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

=== Policy Updates

|*Policy Updates*
|*Description*

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*Azure Function App doesn't use latest TLS version*
//RLP-153936

|The policy RQL will be updated to consider the latest TLS version 1.3.

*Current RQL–* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = properties.state equal ignore case "Running" AND kind contains "functionapp" AND kind does not contain "workflowapp" AND kind does not equal "app" AND config.minTlsVersion does not equal "1.2"
----

*Updated RQL–*
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = properties.state equal ignore case "Running" AND kind contains "functionapp" AND kind does not contain "workflowapp" AND kind does not equal "app" AND config.minTlsVersion is not member of ("1.2", "1.3")
----

*Policy Type–* Config

*Policy Severity–* Low

*Impact–* Low. Open alerts where the minTlsVersion is set to 1.3 will be resolved.

|*Azure Storage Account default network access is set to 'Allow'*
//RLP-154158

|Policy RQL is updated to reduce false positives.

*Current RQL–* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = 'networkRuleSet.defaultAction equals Allow' 
----

*Updated RQL–*
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case "Enabled" AND networkRuleSet.defaultAction equal ignore case "Allow" 
----

*Policy Type–* Config

*Policy Severity–* Informational

*Impact–* Low. Open alerts where the storage account is not publicly accessible from all networks will be resolved.

2+|*Policy Updates - Metadata*

|*Azure App service HTTP logging is disabled*
//RLP-153983

|The recommendation steps will be updated.

*Current Recommendation Steps–* 
1. Log in to Azure Portal
2. Go to App Services dashboard
3. Click on the reported App service
4. Under the 'Monitoring' menu, click on 'App Service logs'
5. Under 'Web server logging', select Storage to store logs on blob storage, or File System to store logs on the App Service file system.
6. In Retention Period (Days), set the number of days the logs should be retained.
7. Click on 'Save' 

As a security best practice, it is recommended to disable public network access for Azure Virtual Machine disks.

*Updated Recommendation Steps–* 

Configuring http logging via User Interface varies depending on the type of Azure App Service.

Alternatively, you may use the CLI command below to configure http logging for all kinds of Azure App Service: 

`az webapp log config --name <App name> --resource-group <Resource Group Name> --web-server-logging filesystem`

*Policy Type–* Config

*Policy Severity–* Low

*Impact–* No impact on alerts.

[#iam-policy-updates]
=== IAM Policy Updates
//RLP-154372

Prisma Cloud version 25.2.1 will include the following policy severity level changes based on our updated risk assessment. These changes are reflective of previously intended changes (version 24.11.1) which did not take place due to internal circumstances. The upcoming changes are outlined below.

*Impact—* Policies not included under any alert rule after the severity change, will have its alerts disappear.

This API now restricts data fetching to when the database is in the 'Online' or 'Ready' states. This ensures operations are only performed during these optimal states, This targeted approach prevents data fetching in any other non-active states effectively reducing costs and improving performance.

Behaviour when the database transitions into a 'Paused' state or any other non-optimal state:

* Data ingestion for affected resources is suspended.
* The deleted status for these specific resources in Prisma is set to "true".
* All alerts related to the paused resources are automatically marked as resolved during this pause.
* Upon the database's return to an 'Online' state, and when data ingestion recommences:

* The "deleted" status in Prisma is reverted to "false".
* Any alerts that were marked as resolved during the pause are reopened.
