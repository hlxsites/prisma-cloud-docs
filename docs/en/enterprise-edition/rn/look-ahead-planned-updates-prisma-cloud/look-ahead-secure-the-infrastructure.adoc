//RLP-134888

|The Alert Info https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/get-alert/[GET alert/:id] response will include a new field `connectionDetails` in release 24.5.2.

|*API Rate Limits*
//RLP-129569, RLP-139236

|Prisma Cloud uses API https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/rate-limits/[rate limits] at the endpoint level to protect the performance and availability of its services. Rate limits will be applied to additional APIs starting from the 24.6.1 release. Details of these rate limits will be made available in the supporting API documentation and Look Ahead Notices when these limits are introduced.

For more information, see the <<api-rate-limits>> table.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.5.2.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

=== Policy Updates

|*Policy Updates*
|*Description*

|*Azure Virtual Network subnet is not configured with a Network Security Group*
//RLP-137711

|*Changes*— The policy description and RQL will be updated.

*Severity*— Low

*Policy Type*— Config

*Current Description—* This policy identifies Azure Virtual Network (VNet) subnets that are not associated with a Network Security Group (NSG). While binding an NSG to a network interface of a Virtual Machine (VM) enables fine-grained control to the VM, associating a NSG to a subnet enables better control over network traffic to all resources within a subnet. As a best practice, associate an NSG with a subnet so that you can protect your VMs on a subnet-level.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#limitations[What is a private endpoint? - Azure Private Link] 

Note: This policy will not report for subnets used by Azure Firewall, Gateway, NetApp File Share, RouteServerSubnet, Private endpoints and Private links as Azure recommends not to configure Network Security Group (NSG) for these services.

*Impact*— Low. Alert for Azure Virtual Network (VNet) subnets used by  `AzureFirewallManagementSubnet` will be resolved. 

|*Azure Storage account encryption key configured by access policy with privileged operations*
//RLP-139004

|*Changes*— The policy RQL will be updated to check if the key vault will use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization of data actions or not.

*Severity*— Medium

*Policy Type*— Config
