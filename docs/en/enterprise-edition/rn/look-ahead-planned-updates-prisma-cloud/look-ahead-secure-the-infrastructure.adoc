[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*New Rate Limits for Search API*
//RLP-151274

|Starting with the 24.12.1 release, to improve user experience and enhance search performance, rate limits will be implemented for the following APIs:

* *Config Search*
** https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/search-config/[search/config]
** https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/search-config-page/[search/config/page]

* *Config Search v1*
** https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/search-config-by-query/[search/api/v1/config]

Request Rate Limit = 150

*Impact—* Requests exceeding the limits will result in an *HTTP 429* Too Many Requests response. See Prisma Cloud API guidance on https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/rate-limits/[Rate Limits].


|*Amazon EC2 VPC Endpoint Service Count Updates*
//RLP-152289

|Starting with the 24.12.1 release, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest EC2 VPC Endpoint Services that are visible to, but not owned by AWS accounts. Only VPC Endpoint Services directly owned by an AWS account will be ingested.

*Impact—* Low. Since the VPC Endpoint Services that will not be ingested are resources owned by Amazon.


// |*GCP API Update*
//RLP-150422 (Older version of blurb above, remove after confirming)

// |*API*: gcloud-container-describe-clusters

// *Change*: The Prisma cloud API will be updated to compute attributes `isMasterVersionSupported` and `isNodeVersionSupported` to provide results based on the latest improvements made by the GCP team with respect to the GetServerConfig API. This enhancement is planned to provide more accurate results for the alerts based on the default policies.

// *Issue*: The default policies GCP GKE unsupported Master node version and GCP GKE unsupported node version are currently checking the GCP GKE version based on major and minor values. To provide accurate results, we are enhancing the Prisma API attribute to compare complete versions from the GCP API.

//*Impact*: New alerts might be triggered based on the complete GKE version used for clusters and nodes.If you have custom policies, you must manually update them to check using the updated attribute.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.12.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.
