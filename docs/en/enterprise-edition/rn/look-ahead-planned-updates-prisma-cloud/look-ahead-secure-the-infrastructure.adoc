[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Tag-based Resource Lists*
//RLP-140177

|Starting with the X release, the following limits will be enforced for Tag-based Resource Lists:

* Tag-based Resource Lists will be limited to 10 key-value pairs
* Up to 5 Tag-based Resource Lists may be associated with a Role

*Impact*: These changes will affect Tag-based Resource Lists and Roles after the X release. Existing configurations will not be affected.

|*API Rate Limits — Update User Role API*
//RLP-141323

|To resolve a critical performance issue with the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/update-user-role/[Update User Role] API (PUT /user/role), a rate limit with the following parameters will be implemented effective 24.6.2.

`Limit=3, Burst=3` 

*Impact*—Requests exceeding these limits will result in an *HTTP 429* Too Many Requests response.

|*Role-Based Access Control for Compliance and Alert Reports*
//RLP-140182

|Starting with the 24.8.1 release, user-generated Reports will only be visible to System Administrators and users with the same role. Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enhances data security by streamlining report access for users with the same role, while also preventing unauthorized access.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.6.2.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.


=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*Azure Application Gateway WAF policy is not enabled in prevention mode*

//RLP-141038

|This policy identifies the Azure Application Gateway WAF policies that are not enabled in prevention mode.

Azure Application Gateway WAF policies support Prevention and Detection modes. Detection mode monitors and logs all threat alerts to a log file. Detection mode is useful for testing purposes and configures WAF initially but it does not provide protection. It logs the traffic, but it doesn't take any actions such as allow or deny. Where as, in Prevention mode, WAF analyzes incoming traffic to the application gateway and blocks any requests that are determined to be malicious based on a set of rules.

As a best security practice, it is recommended to enable Application Gateway WAF policies with Prevention mode to prevent malicious requests from reaching your application and potentially causing damage.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-application-gateway-waf-policy' AND json.rule = properties.applicationGateways[*].id size greater than 0 and properties.policySettings.state equal ignore case Enabled and properties.policySettings.mode does not equal ignore case Prevention

|*Deprecated Endpoints or Parameters*
|*Deprecated Release*

|*Replacement Endpoints*

|*End of support for Azure Data Lake Analytics and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 Services*

//RLP-134902, RLP-127361

|NA
|24.6.1

|The following APIs are planned for deprecation because Azure has announced the retirement of Azure Data Lake Analytics and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 Services. Due to this, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest metadata for the following APIs:

* azure-data-lake-analytics-account
* azure-data-lake-analytics-diagnostic-settings
* azure-data-lake-store-gen1-account
* azure-data-lake-store-gen1-diagnostic-settings

In RQL, the key will not be available in the `api.name` attribute auto-completion.

*Impact*—If you have a saved search or custom policies based on this API, you must delete those manually. The policy alerts will be resolved as Policy_Deleted.


|tt:[*Deprecation of Compliance Standards*]

The following legacy Compliance Standards are planned for deprecation at the end of May 2024. The standards will be removed from the Prisma Cloud console at the end of July 2024.

* MITRE ATT&CK v10.0
* MITRE ATT&CK v6.3
* MITRE ATT&CK v8.2
* HITRUST CSF v9.3
* HITRUST v.9.4.2

//RLP-140241

|To provide better performance, the *Compliance trendline* will start displaying data only from the past one year. Prisma Cloud will not retain the snapshots of data older than one year.
The Compliance-related filters (*Compliance Requirement, Compliance Standard, and Compliance Section*) will not be available on Asset Inventory (*Inventory > Assets*).

|The following endpoints are deprecated as the date filters—time object or time string in query parameters or the request body—used by these APIs will be removed in the updated API endpoints. The updated API endpoints will always return current data.
