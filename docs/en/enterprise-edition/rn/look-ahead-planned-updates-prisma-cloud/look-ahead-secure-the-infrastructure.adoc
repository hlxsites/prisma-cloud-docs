[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*View Saved Filters as Saved Views*
//RLP-128172
 
|Starting with the 24.2.2 release,  Saved Filters on Prisma Cloud will be made available as *Saved Views* on the Alerts, Compliance, and Governance pages.

Navigate to *Home > Alerts/Compliance/Governance > Manage Views* to find your filter combinations available as a Saved View.


|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*

tt:[This change was first announced in the look ahead that was published with the 23.1.1 release.]
//RLP-76433 - verify with PM moving blurb from LA to 24.3.1 RN

|If you currently ingest AWS flow logs using S3 with the 24-hour partition, you need to change it to the hourly partition.

To make this change, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-aws/configure-flow-logs[Configure Flow Logs] to use the hourly partition and enable the required additional fields.

*Impact*— VPC Flow logs with partitions set to *Every 24 hours (default)* will be disabled on February 29th, 2024. As a result, you will no longer be able to monitor or receive alerts for these logs. If you have any questions, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative immediately.

[#new-ips-for-runtime]
=== New IPs for Runtime Security

*Add New IP Addresses for Runtime Security*
//RLP-122832 - Do not remove this blurb till Feb 2024. However, these details have been included in the AG and content collections that went with the 24.2.1 release.

To ensure continued connectivity to the Prisma Cloud console, as a system administrator, review the following IP list and add the new addresses to your allow lists before February 2024. Failure to do so will result in tenant connectivity issues.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents rrent Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.2.2.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

[#policy-updates]
=== Policy Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Policy Updates*
|*Description*

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*GCP Cloud Armor policy not configured with cve-canary rule*
//RLP-127965

|*Changes—* The policy RQL will be updated to exclude checking edge security type of policy as pre-built rules (such as cve-canary) cannot be applied to edge security policy.

*Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-armor-security-policy' AND json.rule = rules[*].match.expr.expression does not contain cve-canary or rules[?any(match.expr.expression contains cve-canary and action equals allow)] exists
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-armor-security-policy' AND json.rule = type does not equal ignore case CLOUD_ARMOR_EDGE and (rules[*].match.expr.expression does not contain cve-canary or rules[?any(match.expr.expression contains cve-canary and action equals allow)] exists)
----

*Impact—* Low. Existing alerts will be resolved as `CLOUD_ARMOR_EDGE` type policies are excluded from the policy RQL.
