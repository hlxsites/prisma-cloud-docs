|*Azure Onboarding Terrafom Update*

|The Microsoft Azure onboarding Terraform script is updated to remove a permission that Microsoft Azure Resource Manager (ARM) has deprecated. The permission below is no longer required during onboarding.

* `Microsoft.MixedReality/ObjectAnchorsAccounts/read`

*Mitigation-* If you encounter an onboarding error, you can remove the permission above and run the Terraform script to resolve the issue.

[#new-policies] 
=== New Policies

To learn about the upcoming new Prisma Cloud policies and updates to existing Prisma Cloud policies, you need access to the *private* Prisma Cloud policies repository on GitHub. The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. 

Contact your Prisma Cloud representative, who will let you know the information required to get access to the repository. Once you receive access to the Prisma Cloud policies repository:

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has a monthly release, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<1>. For example, PCS-25.12.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

2+|*Policy Updates—Metadata*

|*AWS S3 bucket publicly writable*
//RLP-157351

|*Policy Update–* A note is added to the description indicating the exclusion of S3 buckets hosting public static websites.

*Current Description–* 
====
Publicly writable AWS S3 buckets allow unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within. This misconfiguration exposes data to malicious actors and data breaches.

The S3 service relies on Access Control Lists (ACLs) and bucket policies to manage access. Incorrectly configured ACLs or bucket policies that grant 'Put', 'Create', 'Update', 'Replicate', 'Write', or 'Delete' permissions to the world, allow anyone to modify or delete bucket contents. This exposes data to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.

A successful attack could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, resulting in significant financial, legal, and reputational damage. Best practices dictate strict control over S3 bucket permissions to prevent unauthorized access. Data loss and compliance violations are possible consequences.

Implement least privilege access controls. Restrict access to only trusted users and services via appropriately configured ACLs and bucket policies. Regularly review and audit S3 bucket permissions to identify and rectify any misconfigurations. Use strong encryption to protect data at rest and in transit. Employ multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
