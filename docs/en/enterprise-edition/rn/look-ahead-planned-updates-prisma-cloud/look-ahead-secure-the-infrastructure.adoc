[#new-policies] 
=== New Policies

To learn about the upcoming new Prisma Cloud policies and updates to existing Prisma Cloud policies, you need access to the *private* Prisma Cloud policies repository on GitHub. The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. 

Contact your Prisma Cloud representative, who will let you know the information required to get access to the repository. Once you receive access to the Prisma Cloud policies repository:

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has a monthly release, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<1>. For example, PCS-25.7.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|*AWS EKS cluster does not have secrets encryption enabled*
//RLP-156100

|*Changes–* The policy will be updated to identify EKS clusters with versions lesser than 1.28 as per the latest CSP updates.

*Current Description–* 

This policy identifies AWS EKS clusters that do not have secrets encryption enabled.

AWS EKS cluster secrets are, by default, stored unencrypted in the API server's underlying data store (etcd). Anyone with direct access to etcd or with API access can retrieve or modify the secrets. Using secrets encryption for your Amazon EKS cluster allows you to protect sensitive information such as passwords and API keys using Kubernetes-native APIs.

It is recommended to enable secrets encryption to ensure its security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

*Updated Description–*

This policy identifies AWS EKS clusters that do not have secrets encryption enabled. 

AWS EKS cluster secrets are, by default, stored unencrypted in the API server's underlying data store (etcd). Anyone with direct access to etcd or with API access can retrieve or modify the secrets. Using secrets encryption for your Amazon EKS cluster allows you to protect sensitive information such as passwords and API keys using Kubernetes-native APIs. 

It is recommended to enable secrets encryption to ensure its security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. 

NOTE: The policy identifies secret encryptions for EKS clusters with versions lesser than 1.28. 

*Current RQL–* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-eks-describe-cluster' AND json.rule = encryptionConfig does not exist or (encryptionConfig exists and encryptionConfig[*].provider.keyArn does not exist and encryptionConfig[*].resources[*] does not contain secrets)
----

*Updated RQL–*
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-eks-describe-cluster' AND json.rule = version is member of ( "1.25", "1.26", "1.27") and (encryptionConfig does not exist or (encryptionConfig exists and encryptionConfig[*].provider.keyArn does not exist and encryptionConfig[*].resources[*] does not contain secrets))
----

*Policy Type–* Config 

*Policy Severity–* Medium

*Impact–* Low. Open alerts for EKS clusters with versions higher than 1.27 will be resolved. 



|*Azure SQL server public network access setting is enabled*
//RLP-156277

|*Changes–* The policy description and remediation steps will be updated to reflect the latest changes in Azure to ensure accurate remediation of flagged resources.

*Current Description–*

This policy identifies Azure SQL servers which have public network access setting enabled. Publicly accessible SQL servers are vulnerable to external threats with risk of unauthorized access or may remotely exploit any vulnerabilities. It is recommended to configure the SQL servers with IP-based strict server-level firewall rules or virtual-network rules or private endpoints so that servers are accessible only to restricted entities.

*Updated Description–*

This policy identifies Azure SQL servers which have public network access setting enabled. Publicly accessible SQL servers are vulnerable to external threats with risk of unauthorized access or may remotely exploit any vulnerabilities. It is recommended to disable public network access to the Azure SQL servers and use private endpoints or virtual network service endpoints to secure connectivity.

|*Azure SQL server using insecure TLS version*
//RLP-156262

|*Changes–* The policy RQL will be updated to eliminate the check for "NONE" since it now defaults to using version 1.2 or 1.3 in accordance with the latest CSP updates.

*Current RQL–* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = ['sqlServer'].['properties.state'] equal ignore case "Ready" and (['sqlServer'].['properties.minimalTlsVersion'] equal ignore case "None" or ['sqlServer'].['properties.minimalTlsVersion'] equals "1.0" or ['sqlServer'].['properties.minimalTlsVersion'] equals "1.1")
----

*Updated RQL–*
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = ['sqlServer'].['properties.state'] equal ignore case "Ready" and (['sqlServer'].['properties.minimalTlsVersion'] equals "1.0" or ['sqlServer'].['properties.minimalTlsVersion'] equals "1.1")
----

*Policy Type–* Config 

*Policy Severity–* Low

Azure Front Door Web application firewall (WAF) policy rule for Remote Command Execution is disabled

*Updated Name–*

Azure Front Door (Classic) Web application firewall (WAF) policy rule for Remote Command Execution is disabled

*Current Description–* 

This policy identifies Azure Front Door Web application firewall (WAF) policies that have the Remote Command Execution rule disabled. It is recommended to define the criteria in the WAF policy with the rule ‘Remote Command Execution (944240)’ under managed rules to help in detecting and mitigating Log4j vulnerability.
