[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)*
//RLP-150134; Added in LA in 9.1; updated text in 9.2; move to Features Introduced in October > Changes in Existing Behavior.

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, the format of `external_asset_id` for `aws-ecr-image` resources will change. As a result, all existing `aws-ecr-image` resources will be deleted in Prisma Cloud and the corresponding *Open* alerts will be resolved as *Closed*.

Prisma Cloud will automatically fetch all the live ECR images from your cloud accounts and create them as new resources with the new `external_asset_id` format. New alerts will be generated for resources that match the active policies in your tenant.

*Impact—* You may notice a temporary drop in `aws-ecr-image` resource count and open alert count. However, after the `aws-ecr-image` resources are automatically ingested, the corresponding live resource count and open alert count will return to the previous levels.


// |*Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)*
//RLP-150134
// |Starting with the 24.10.1 release, the `external_asset_id` for `aws-ecr-image` in Prisma Cloud will be updated in the backend. As a result, all resources for `aws-ecr-image` API will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.
// Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Closed, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.
// *Impact—* You may notice a reduced count for the number of alerts. However, once the resources for the aws-ecr-image API resumes ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.


|*Amazon EC2 Ingestion*
//RLP-145171

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest private Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) owned by other accounts unless they are actively used by EC2 instances within the current account.

*Impact—* No impact on out-of-the-box (OOTB) policies. However, if you have custom policies, you must manually update them to check for private AMIs not owned by the same account and not currently deployed.

If you have any questions, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.

|*Alerts for Role Chaining*
//IVG-15421

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, enhancements to Prisma Cloud Identity and Entitlement Management (CIEM) capabilities will alert users when role chaining is present in their environment. Role chaining occurs when you use a role to assume a second role. This results in the newly granted role assuming all the permissions granted to the first role.

*Impact—* To detect role chaining, new permissions will be created where AWS roles as the source serves as the principal of another role. These new permissions could lead to new alerts being generated, where they did not exist before.


|*Google Kubernetes Engine*
//RLP-150422, Check the fixversion again before moving the blurb in 10.1. The Fixversion may change to 11.1.

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, the JSON resource attributes `isMasterVersionSupported` and `isNodeVersionSupported` for *gcloud-container-describe-clusters* API will be updated to align with the CSP *GetServerConfig* API. This change will provide accurate results for policy violation alerts related to the default policies— *GCP GKE unsupported Master node version* and *GCP GKE unsupported node version*.

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts. New alerts will be generated against policy violations based on the complete GKE version used for clusters and nodes. If you have custom policies, you must manually update them to receive the alerts.


|*Updates to GCP Terraform Template*
//RLP-150820

|Starting with the 24.10.1 release, a subset of Viewer role permissions needed for API ingestions will be added to the existing Custom role present in the Google Terraform template. Also, the original Viewer role containing necessary permissions will still be available in the template.

With this change, you need not manually enter the necessary API permissions under custom roles in case you decide not to grant Prisma Cloud Viewer role permissions.

*Impact—* This change will not affect the onboarding *Status* of your accounts.


|*Audit Logs Pagination and Filter*
//RLP-151119

|Starting with the 24.11.1 release, the Audit Logs will include enhancements to improve performance, reduce data load times, and provide more granular control over data retrieval:

* The Audit Logs page will display paginated data, which will enhance navigation through extensive logs and the filtering options will provide you with more control over your log data. 

* You will also be able to use the new API to programatically leverage the new pagination and filter capabilities to streamline your use cases. 


|*Rate Limits — RQL Service APIs*
//RLP-151274

|Starting with the 24.12.1 release, to improve Prisma Cloud performance, rate limits will be implemented for the RQL service APIs.

*Impact—* Requests exceeding the limits will result in an *HTTP 429* Too Many Requests response.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.10.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.


[#policy-updates]
=== Policy Updates

[cols="35%a,65%a"]
|===
|*Policy Updates*
|*Description*

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*Azure Storage Account without Secure transfer enabled*
//RLP-149572
|*Changes—* The policy description and RQL will be updated to ignore storage accounts where the secure transfer property is not applicable for NFS Azure file shares to work.

*Current Description—* This policy identifies Storage accounts which have Secure transfer feature disabled. The secure transfer option enhances the security of your storage account by only allowing requests to the storage account by a secure connection. When 'secure transfer required' is enabled, REST APIs to access your storage accounts connect using HTTPs any requests using HTTP will be rejected. When you are using the Azure files service, connection without encryption will fail. It is highly recommended to enable secure transfer feature on your storage account.

NOTE: Azure storage doesn't support HTTPs for custom domain names, this option is not applied when using a custom domain name.

*Updated Description—* This policy identifies Storage accounts which have Secure transfer feature disabled. The secure transfer option enhances the security of your storage account by only allowing requests to the storage account by a secure connection. 

When "secure transfer required" is disabled, REST APIs to access your storage accounts may connect over insecure HTTP which is not advised. Hence, it is highly recommended to enable secure transfer feature on your storage account.

NOTE: Azure storage doesn't support HTTPs for custom domain names, this option is not applied when using a custom domain name. Additionally, this property is not applicable for NFS Azure file shares to work.

*Current RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = properties.supportsHttpsTrafficOnly !exists or properties.supportsHttpsTrafficOnly is false
----

*Updated RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = (properties.supportsHttpsTrafficOnly does not exist or properties.supportsHttpsTrafficOnly is false) as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-storage-file-shares' as Y; filter '($.X.kind does not equal ignore case "FileStorage") or ($.X.kind equal ignore case "FileStorage" and $.Y.id contains $.X.name and $.Y.properties.enabledProtocols does not contain NFS)'; show X;
----

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*Impact—* Low. Existing alerts on the Storage account using the NFS Azure file will be resolved as *Policy_Updated*.

|*GCP Cloud Function v1 is using unsecured HTTP trigger*
//RLP-149695
|*Changes—* The policy RQL will be updated to check only the appropriate GCP Cloud Function v1 that has an unsecured HTTP trigger.

*Current RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-cloud-function-v2' AND json.rule = state equals "ACTIVE" AND environment equals "GEN_1" AND serviceConfig.securityLevel does not equal "SECURE_ALWAYS"
----

*Updated RQL—* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-cloud-function-v2' AND json.rule = state equals ACTIVE AND environment equals GEN_1 AND serviceConfig.securityLevel exists AND serviceConfig.securityLevel does not equal SECURE_ALWAYS
----

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*Impact—* Low. Existing alerts for the GCP Cloud Function v1 where the *Require HTTPS* configuration does not apply will be resolved as *Policy_Updated*.

|===

[#iam-policy-update]
=== IAM Policy Updates

The policy *Severity* levels for the following IAM policies will be adjusted to better align with the potential risks they pose.

*Impact—* If your alert rules use the *Policy Severity* filter, you may notice a slight change in the number of alerts. However, this change will not affect custom policies or policies where you have manually set the severity levels. For policies included in alert rules that are not based on severity, the number of alerts will remain unchanged.

If you have any questions, reach out to your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.

|The `accountGroup` response parameter was introduced in error and is now deprecated for Get Asset - https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/get-asset-details-by-id/[GET - uai/v1/asset] API endpoint.


|tt:[*End of support for Google Cloud Function v1 API*]
//RLP-142340

|NA
|24.10.1
|`gcloud-cloud-function-v1` API is planned for deprecation. Due to this change, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest metadata for `gcloud-cloud-function-v1 API`. 

In RQL, the key will not be available in the api.name attribute auto-completion. As a replacement, it is recommended to use the `gcloud-cloud-function-v2` API.

*Impact*—If you have a saved search or custom policies based on this API, you must delete those manually. The policy alerts will be resolved as Policy_Deleted.


|tt:[*Deprecation of End Timestamp in Config Search*]
//RLP-126583, suset release TBD
| - 
| - 
|The end timestamp in the date selector for Config Search will soon be deprecated after which it will be ignored for all existing RQLs. You will only need to choose a start timestamp without having to specify the end timestamp.

|tt:[*Prisma Cloud CSPM REST API for Alerts*]
//RLP-25031, RLP-25937

Query parameter `risk.grade` is deprecated for the following requests:

*  `GET /alert`
*  `GET /v2/alert`
*  `GET /alert/policy` 

Request body parameter `risk.grade` is deprecated for the following requests:

*  `POST /alert`
*  `POST /v2/alert`
*  `POST /alert/policy`

//tt:[*Change to Compliance Trendline and Deprecation of Compliance Filters*]
//RLP-126719, need to check if this notice can be moved to current features in 24.1.2

//- 
//To provide better performance, the *Compliance trendline* will start displaying data only from the past one year. Prisma Cloud will not retain the snapshots of data older than one year.
//The Compliance-related filters (*Compliance Requirement, Compliance Standard, and Compliance Section*) will not be available on Asset Inventory (*Inventory > Assets*).
