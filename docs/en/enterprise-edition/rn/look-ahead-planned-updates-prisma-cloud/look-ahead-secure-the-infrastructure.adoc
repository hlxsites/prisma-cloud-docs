[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*


|*Multiselect Disabled for Alert Rule Name Filter*
//RLP-147561

|Starting with 24.8.2 release, you will no longer be able to select multiple alert rules in the *Alert Rule Name* filter on the *Alerts > Overview* page. The multiselect option will be disabled to eliminate inconsistent results when filtering more than one alert rule. 

When using the `POST/alerts/policy` API, make sure to include only one *Alert Rule Name* in the filters attribute of the request body schema.

|*Change in Amazon EC2 Ingestion*
//RLP-145171

|Starting with the 24.9.1 release, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest private Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) owned by other accounts unless they are actively used by EC2 instances within the current account.

*Impact—* No impact on out-of-the-box (OOTB) policies. However, if you have custom policies, you must manually update them to check for private AMIs not owned by the same account and not currently deployed.

If you have any questions, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.8.2.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

2+|*Policy Updates—Metadata*

|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*AWS SageMaker endpoint data encryption at rest not configured with CMK*
//RLP-147139

tt:[24.8.2]

|*Changes—* The policy description is revised as follows:

*Current Policy Name—* AWS SageMaker endpoint data encryption at rest not configured

*Updated Policy Name—* AWS SageMaker endpoint data encryption at rest not configured with CMK 

*Current Policy Description—* This policy identifies AWS SageMaker Endpoints not configured with data encryption at rest.

AWS SageMaker Endpoint configuration defines the resources and settings for deploying machine learning models to SageMaker endpoints. By default, SageMaker Endpoints are not encrypted at rest. Enabling the encryption helps protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data on the storage volume attached to the ML compute instance that hosts the endpoint.

It is recommended to set encryption at rest to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

*Updated Policy Description—* This policy identifies AWS SageMaker Endpoints not configured with data encryption at rest.

AWS SageMaker Endpoint configuration defines the resources and settings for deploying machine learning models to SageMaker endpoints. By default, SageMaker encryption uses transient keys if a KMS key is not specified, which does not provide the control and management benefits of AWS Customer Managed KMS Key. Enabling the encryption helps protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data on the storage volume attached to the ML compute instance that hosts the endpoint.

It is recommended to set encryption at rest to mitigate the risk of unauthorised access and potential data breaches.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.
