[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*


|*Audit Logs Pagination and Filter*
//RLP-151119

|Starting with the 24.11.1 release, the Audit Logs will include enhancements to improve performance, reduce data load times, and provide more granular control over data retrieval:

* The Audit Logs page will display paginated data, which will enhance navigation through extensive logs and the filtering options will provide you with more control over your log data. 

* You will also be able to use the new API to programatically leverage the new pagination and filter capabilities to streamline your use cases. 

|*Governance Dashboard and Policy Endpoint Updates*
//RLP-150508

|Starting with the 24.11.1 release, a new filter option for *Asset Type* will be added to the *Governance* page. This will allow users to filter the policy list based on the type of asset associated with the policy.

The https://api.prismacloud.io/v2/policy[GET /v2/policy] endpoint will have a new query parameter `resource.type` to enable filtering the policy list by asset type. The response will also include the `resource.type` to indicate the Asset Type associated with each returned policy.

The CSV download from the *Governance* page will also include a new column *Asset Type*.

|*Google Kubernetes Engine*
//RLP-150422

|Starting with the 11.1 release, the JSON resource attributes `isMasterVersionSupported` and `isNodeVersionSupported` for *gcloud-container-describe-clusters* API will be updated to align with the CSP *GetServerConfig* API. This change will provide accurate results for policy violation alerts related to the default policies— *GCP GKE unsupported Master node version* and *GCP GKE unsupported node version*.

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts. New alerts will be generated against policy violations based on the complete GKE version used for clusters and nodes. If you have custom policies, you must manually update them to receive the alerts.

|*AWS Identity Store User Count Updates*
//RLp-151885

|Starting with the 24.11.1 release, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest AWS Identity Store users that are visible to, but not owned by, AWS accounts. Going forward, only users directly owned by an AWS account will be ingested.

*Impact*: Any existing alerts for AWS Identity Store users in accounts that do not own the respective Identity Stores will be automatically closed.


// |*GCP API Update*
//RLP-150422 (Older version of blurb above, remove after confirming)

// |*API*: gcloud-container-describe-clusters

// *Change*: The Prisma cloud API will be updated to compute attributes `isMasterVersionSupported` and `isNodeVersionSupported` to provide results based on the latest improvements made by the GCP team with respect to the GetServerConfig API. This enhancement is planned to provide more accurate results for the alerts based on the default policies.

// *Issue*: The default policies GCP GKE unsupported Master node version and GCP GKE unsupported node version are currently checking the GCP GKE version based on major and minor values. To provide accurate results, we are enhancing the Prisma API attribute to compare complete versions from the GCP API.

//*Impact*: New alerts might be triggered based on the complete GKE version used for clusters and nodes.If you have custom policies, you must manually update them to check using the updated attribute.


|*Rate Limits — RQL Service APIs*
//RLP-151274

|Starting with the 24.12.1 release, to improve Prisma Cloud performance, rate limits will be implemented for the RQL service APIs.

*Impact—* Requests exceeding the limits will result in an *HTTP 429* Too Many Requests response.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.11.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|*Policy Updates*
|*Description*


|*Azure DNS Zone having dangling DNS Record vulnerable to subdomain takeover associated with Web App Service*
//RLP-152208

|The policy logic will be updated to prevent false positives for resources that are stopped but still valid. This will ensure that only genuinely dangling DNS records are flagged as alerts.

*Current RQL–*: 
----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-dns-recordsets' AND json.rule = type contains CNAME and properties.CNAMERecord.cname contains "azurewebsites.net" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = properties.state equal ignore case Running as Y;  filter 'not ($.Y.properties.hostNames contains $.X.properties.CNAMERecord.cname) '; show X;
----

*Updated RQL–*:
----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-dns-recordsets' AND json.rule = type contains CNAME and properties.CNAMERecord.cname contains "azurewebsites.net" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-app-service' as Y; filter 'not ($.Y.properties.hostNames contains $.X.properties.CNAMERecord.cname) '; show X;
----

*Policy Type*: Config

*Policy Severity*: High

*Alert Impact*: Low

*Impact*: Open alerts on the Logic App have public access disabled using default behavior with a private endpoint configured will be resolved.


|*Azure Logic App configured with public network access*
//RLP-150603

|RQL will be updated to avoid false positives in case the Logic App has public access disabled using default behavior with a private endpoint configured.

*Current RQL–*: 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = 'properties.state equal ignore case running and kind contains workflowapp and ((properties.publicNetworkAccess exists and properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled) or (properties.publicNetworkAccess does not exist)) and config.ipSecurityRestrictions[?any((action equals Allow and ipAddress equals Any) or (action equals Allow and ipAddress equals 0.0.0.0/0))] exists'
----

*Updated RQL–*:
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = 'properties.state equal ignore case running and kind contains workflowapp and ((properties.publicNetworkAccess exists and properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled) or (properties.publicNetworkAccess does not exist and (properties.privateLinkIdentifiers does not exist or properties.privateLinkIdentifiers is empty))) and config.ipSecurityRestrictions[?any((action equals Allow and ipAddress equals Any) or (action equals Allow and ipAddress equals 0.0.0.0/0))] exists'
----

*Policy Type*: Config

*Policy Severity*: Medium

*Alert Impact*: Low

*Impact*: Open alerts on the Logic App have public access disabled using default behavior with a private endpoint configured will be resolved.


|*GCP SQL Instances do not have valid SSL configuration*
//RLP-150532

|*Current Policy Description–*

This policy identifies GCP SQL instances that do not have valid SSL configuration with an unexpired SSL certificate. Cloud SQL supports connecting to an instance using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If Cloud SQL Auth proxy is not used for authentication, it is recommended to utilize SSL for connection to SQL Instance, ensuring the security for data in transit.

*Updated Policy Description–*

This policy identifies GCP SQL instances that either lack SSL configuration or have SSL certificates that have expired.

If an SQL instance is not configured to use SSL, it may accept unencrypted and insecure connections, leading to potential risks such as data interception and authentication vulnerabilities.

It is a best practice to enable SSL configuration to ensure data security and integrity when communicating with a GCP SQL instance.

*Current Policy RQL–*
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-sql-instances-list' and json.rule = "(settings.ipConfiguration.requireSsl is true and _DateTime.ageInDays(serverCaCert.expirationTime) > -1) or not (settings.ipConfiguration.requireSsl is true)"
----
*Updated Policy RQL–*
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-sql-instances-list' and json.rule = "(settings.ipConfiguration.sslMode equal ignore case TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED and _DateTime.ageInDays(serverCaCert.expirationTime) > -1) or settings.ipConfiguration.sslMode equal ignore case ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED"
----
 
*Policy Type*: Config

*Policy Severity*: Low

*Impact*: 

Low. Alerts will be triggered in case the SQL instance is configured with SSL mode as ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED or TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED with expired certificate

Open Alerts will be resolved in case the SQL instance is configured with SSL mode as ENCRYPTED_ONLY or TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED with valid certificate. 

|===


[#iam-policy-update]
=== IAM Policy Updates

The policy *Severity* levels for the following IAM policies will be adjusted to better align with the potential risks they pose.

*Impact—* If your alert rules use the *Policy Severity* filter, you may notice a slight change in the number of alerts. However, this change will not affect custom policies or policies where you have manually set the severity levels. For policies included in alert rules that are not based on severity, the number of alerts will remain unchanged.

If you have any questions, reach out to your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.
