|*Description*

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*Azure Function App doesn't use latest TLS version*
//RLP-153936

|*Changes—* The policy description and reccomendation steps will be updated. The RQL policy will also be updated to consider the latest TLS version 1.3.

*Current Description–* 
This policy identifies Azure Function Apps that are not set with the latest version of TLS encryption. Azure currently allows the Function App to set TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. Using the latest TLS 1.2 version for Function App secure connections is highly recommended.

*Updated Description–*
This policy identifies Azure Function App which are not set with the latest version of TLS encryption.

Azure currently allows the Function App to set TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer regarded as secure protocols and are deemed outdated.

As a security best practice, TLS 1.2 or above is typically advised as the minimum TLS version for Azure function apps. 

*Current RQL–* 
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = properties.state equal ignore case "Running" AND kind contains "functionapp" AND kind does not contain "workflowapp" AND kind does not equal "app" AND config.minTlsVersion does not equal "1.2"

|*GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for VPC network changes*
//RLP-153451
|*Changes—* The policy description and reccomendation steps will be updated align with current standards of the policy. Also, the RQL will be updated to stay in line with the CSP changes.

*Current Description–* 
This policy identifies the GCP account which does not have a log metric filter and alert for VPC network changes. Monitoring network insertion, patching, deletion, removePeering and addPeering activities will help in identifying VPC traffic flow is not getting impacted. It is recommended to create a metric filter and alarm to detect activities related to the insertion, patching, deletion, removePeering and addPeering of VPC network.

*Updated Description–*
This policy identifies GCP accounts that do not have a log metric filter and alert for VPC network changes.

Without proper monitoring of activities like network insertions, patching, deletions, and peering modifications, organizations risk undetected misconfigurations that could compromise network security and impact traffic flow. Real-time alerts on these events are crucial for rapid response to malicious activity or accidental changes, ensuring network integrity and availability. Establishing these monitoring capabilities provides a critical layer of visibility and control over VPC network configurations.

It is recommended to create a log metric filter and alert configuration in your GCP project for VPC network changes. This will enable proactive detection of unauthorized modifications and ensure the integrity and security of your VPC network.

|*GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for VPC Network Firewall rule changes*
//RLP-153453
|*Changes—* The policy description and reccomendation steps will be updated align with current standards of the policy. Also, the RQL will be updated to stay in line with the CSP changes.

*Current Description–* 
This policy identifies the GCP account which does not have a log metric filter and alert for VPC network changes. Monitoring network insertion, patching, deletion, removePeering and addPeering activities will help in identifying VPC traffic flow is not getting impacted. It is recommended to create a metric filter and alarm to detect activities related to the insertion, patching, deletion, removePeering and addPeering of VPC network.

*Updated Description–*
This policy identifies GCP projects that do not have log metric filters and alerts for VPC Network Firewall rule modifications.

VPC Network Firewall rules govern network traffic flow, and unauthorized changes can severely impact security and availability. Without real-time monitoring and alerting on rule modifications (additions, deletions, or updates), organizations are vulnerable to undetected attacks, misconfigurations, and performance issues. Proactive alerts enable swift responses to suspicious activity, preventing breaches and ensuring business continuity. Implementing this monitoring provides crucial visibility and control over network security posture.

It is recommended to configure log metric filters and alerts within your GCP projects to monitor all VPC Network Firewall rule changes. This will enable prompt detection of unauthorized modifications, facilitating rapid remediation and maintaining the integrity and security of your network infrastructure.

2+|*Policy Updates - Metadata*

|*Azure App service HTTP logging is disabled*
//RLP-153983

|*Changes—* The recommendation steps will be updated.

*Current Recommendation Steps–* 
1. Log in to Azure Portal
2. Go to App Services dashboard
3. Click on the reported App service
4. Under the 'Monitoring' menu, click on 'App Service logs'
5. Under 'Web server logging', select Storage to store logs on blob storage, or File System to store logs on the App Service file system.
6. In Retention Period (Days), set the number of days the logs should be retained.
7. Click on 'Save' 

As a security best practice, it is recommended to disable public network access for Azure Virtual Machine disks.

*Updated Recommendation Steps–* 

Configuring http logging via User Interface varies depending on the type of Azure App Service.

Alternatively, you may use the CLI command below to configure http logging for all kinds of Azure App Service: 

`az webapp log config --name <App name> --resource-group <Resource Group Name> --web-server-logging filesystem`

*Policy Type–* Config

*Policy Severity–* Low

*Impact–* No impact on alerts.

|*GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for Project Ownership assignments/changes*
//RLP-153450
|*Changes—* The policy description will be updated to better align with the policy.

*Current Description–* 
This policy identifies the GCP account which does not have a log metric filter and alert for Project Ownership assignments/changes. Project Ownership Having highest level of privileges on a project, to avoid misuse of project resources project ownership assignment/change actions mentioned should be monitored and alerted to concerned recipients.

*Updated Description–*
This policy identifies GCP projects that do not have log metric filters and alert for project ownership assignments and changes.

Project ownership grants extensive privileges. Without monitoring ownership changes, organizations risk unauthorized access, resource misappropriation, and potential security breaches. Real-time alerts on ownership transfers enable prompt detection of suspicious activity, facilitating rapid response and minimizing the impact of compromised accounts. Establishing this monitoring provides crucial visibility and control over project access, improving overall security posture.

It is recommended to configure log metric filters and alerts for project ownership changes in all GCP projects. This proactive approach ensures that any changes to project ownership are immediately flagged, allowing for timely investigation and mitigation of potential risks.

*Policy Type–* Config

*Policy Severity–* Informational

*Impact–* Low. New alerts will be generated for the failing resources.

|*GCP IAM user with service account privileges*
//RLP-153760
|*Changes—* The policy name and description will be updated to better align with the policy.

*Current Policy Name–* GCP IAM user with service account privileges

*Updated Policy Name–* GCP IAM principals with service account privileges

*Current Description–* This policy identifies IAM users which have overly permissive service account privileges. Any user should not have Service Account Admin and Service Account User, both roles assigned at a time. Built-in/Predefined IAM role Service Account admin allows the user to create, delete, manage service accounts. Built-in/Predefined IAM role Service Account User allows the user to assign service accounts to Apps/Compute Instances. It is recommended to follow the principle of 'Separation of Duties' ensuring that one individual does not have all the necessary permissions to be able to complete a malicious action or meant to help avoid security or privacy incidents and errors.

*Updated Description–* This policy identifies IAM principals which have overly permissive service account privileges.

Assigning a principals the Service account role in Google Cloud allows them to  impersonate service accounts and use their permissions. This means the principals can perform actions on behalf of the service account, essentially inheriting all permissions granted to that service account.

To maintain the security of your information and resources, it is crucial to assign this role only to authorized and trusted IAM Principals. 

*Policy Type–* Config

*Policy Severity–* Low

*Impact–* No impact on alerts.

This API now restricts data fetching to when the database is in the 'Online' or 'Ready' states. This ensures operations are only performed during these optimal states, This targeted approach prevents data fetching in any other non-active states effectively reducing costs and improving performance.

Behaviour when the database transitions into a 'Paused' state or any other non-optimal state:

* Data ingestion for affected resources is suspended.
* The deleted status for these specific resources in Prisma is set to "true".
* All alerts related to the paused resources are automatically marked as resolved during this pause.
* Upon the database's return to an 'Online' state, and when data ingestion recommences:

* The "deleted" status in Prisma is reverted to "false".
* Any alerts that were marked as resolved during the pause are reopened.
