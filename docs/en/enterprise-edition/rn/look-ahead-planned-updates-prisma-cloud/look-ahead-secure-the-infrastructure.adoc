[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*


|*Role-Based Access Control for Compliance and Alert Reports*
//RLP-140182

|Starting with the 24.8.1 release, user-generated reports will only be visible to System Administrators and to users with the same role.

Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enhances data security by streamlining report access for users with the same role, while also preventing unauthorized access.

|*Create or Update Policy Permissions*
//RLP-139027

|Starting with the 24.8.1 release, Create/Update Policy Permissions will be divided into the two granular permissions below:

* Policy
* Manage Policy Compliance Mapping

*Impact—* 

* Users managing new custom permission groups will have to select both permissions explicitly if they want to assign compliance mappings during policy create/update operation.
* Manage policy compliance mapping will be added by default to all existing permission groups with policy create/update permissions.

|*Change in Amazon EC2 Ingestion*
//RLP-145171

|Starting with the 24.9.1 release, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest private Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) owned by other accounts unless they are actively used by EC2 instances within the current account.

*Impact—* No impact on out-of-the-box (OOTB) policies. However, if you have custom policies, you must manually update them to check for private AMIs not owned by the same account and not currently deployed.

If you have any questions, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.8.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

[#iam-policy-updates]
=== IAM Policy Updates


The following IAM OOTB policies will be updated in the 24.8.1 release.

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Policies*
|*Description*

|*Third-Party Service Account with High Privileges*
//RLP-146497

|*Description—* Identifies instances of third-party vendor owned service accounts which are granted high privileges and may obtain significant administrative access to your cloud environment. Such permissions can potentially lead to unauthorized access or escalation of privileges, compromising the security posture of your organization.

*Severity—* Medium

*Cloud—* GCP

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'GCP' AND grantedby.cloud.entity.type = 'serviceaccount' AND action.access.isAdministrative = true AND source.cloud.account.isvendor = true AND grantedby.level.type IN ( 'GCP Organization', 'GCP Folder', 'GCP Project' )
----

*Recommendation Steps—*

How to investigate?
1. Sign in to the GCP Console.
2. Browse to the IAM service and search for the affected Service Account.
3. Examine the Service Account's roles and permissions as well as its use case - if needed reach out to the vendor to validate which permissions are necessary for their functions and why. You can reference GCP's 'excess permissions' on the same screen. In order to remove any unnecessary permissions and minimize the role's access, use the following remediation steps:

To revoke the vendor's access altogether, select 'edit principal' and remove all the roles from the Service Account. To minimize the access the vendor has using the Service Account, remove all unnecessary roles and attach one with the minimal permissions needed by the vendor

|*User account with high privileges and MFA disabled*
//RLP-146497

|*Description—*
	
Identifies user accounts with administrative permissions for which Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enabled. Sensitive accounts such as those with administrative permissions are considered high value to attackers and tend to be targeted. As such, these accounts, when not safeguarded by an additional authentication factor, have a higher chance of successful compromise, which would result in the adversary gaining administrative permissions within your ogranization.

*Severity—* High

*Cloud—* All Clouds

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from iam where action.access.isAdministrative = true AND source.cloud.resource.type = 'user' AND source.mfaenabled = False
----

*Recommendation Steps—*

How to investigate?

How to investigate?
1. Sign in to the Cloud Console.
2. Browse to the IAM service and search for the affected user.
3. Examine the user's permissions as well as their role within your organization and determine whether the principle of least privilege is followed.
4. For remediation, use the following remediation steps:

If deemed unnecessary, remove permissions to minimize the user's access. Additionally, enforce MFA on the user. Upon their next login, the user will be prompted to enroll, activating their MFA method
