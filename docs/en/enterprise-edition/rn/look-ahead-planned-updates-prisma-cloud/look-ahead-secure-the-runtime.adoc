=== Defender Upgrade

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|Plan to Upgrade Defender Versions 22.12 and Earlier
|With the v32.00.xx (O'Neal) release, Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2) are `v32.xx.xxx`, `v31.xx.xxx`, and `v30.xx.xxx`.
To prepare for this update, you must upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.12.xx.xxx` (Lagrange) or earlier to a later version. Failure to upgrade Defenders will result in disconnection of any Defender version below 30.xx such as 22.12.

[#addressed-issues]
=== Addressed Issues

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
//CWP-48205 //PCSUP-15977
|-
|Fixed an issue that stopped the registry scan due to an invalid credentials error. The registry scan now completes on credential fetch errors.

//CWP-44286
|-
|Fixed an issue wherein the VMWare Blobstore scan results failed to refresh and show some apps in the scan results. This is fixed by deleting the TAS droplets cache at the end of the scan procedure.

//CWP-52476
|-
|Fixed deployment error issues in VMWare TAS due to Defender termination. This issue was fixed by setting TAS to wait until the Defender exits gracefully when the job is stopped.

//CWP-52169
|-
|Fixed an issue wherein the Tanzu apps were missing under *Monitor > Vulnerabilities* scan results for the deployed images on the Diego cells and image scanning for TAS applications mounted on the external system took extremely long.
To fix this issue, the Defender scan now ignores scanning the images of TAS applications mounted on the external filesystem.

//CWP-52736
|-
|In `v31.02.133`, the new 81 out-of-box admission control rules in Rego were not available by default. This is now fixed. With the `v32.00` Console, you now get all the 81 OOB admission control rules. 

//CWP-51754
|-
|Fixed an issue where the "sourceType" field was missing for Splunk alert messages. You can now add "sourceType" field to the custom alert JSON of Splunk and Prisma Cloud will define the external field based on the custom one.
