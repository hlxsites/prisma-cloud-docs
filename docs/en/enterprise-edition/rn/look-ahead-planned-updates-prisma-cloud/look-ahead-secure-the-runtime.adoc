|CWP-63033

|*Feature*
|*Description*
//CWP-62948
|Removal of Stale Hosts and Images
|We're implementing a fix that will remove outdated assets that are no longer protected by a Defender. These assets should have been automatically deleted previously, but were not. 

With this update, you might notice that certain stale assets are no longer present in your inventory. As a result, you might also see a reduction in vulnerabilities and compliance findings due to their removal.
