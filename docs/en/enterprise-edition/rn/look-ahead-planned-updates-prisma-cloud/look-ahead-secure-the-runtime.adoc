=== Enhancements
[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===

|*Feature*
|*Description*

//CWP-64072 
|NVD score utilization and impact
|NVD traditionally provides two scores: a primary score from NIST and a secondary score from other sources. Previously, the secondary score was not used, even when the primary score was unavailable.

*Updated behavior*

* If the NVD primary score is missing and a CISA ADP secondary score is available, the secondary score will be used as the CVE score (for example,  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8671).
* Once the NVD primary score becomes available, it will revert to being the CVE score. 

*Note:* The secondary score is used only if the primary score is not available and the secondary score is based on a CISA-ADP evaluation.

*Impact on vulnerability reporting*

This improvement will lead to a change in how vulnerabilities are classified. Previously, vulnerabilities without a score, would be assigned a score of “0" and were categorized as "Low" severity. With this enhancement, they will now be assigned the CVSS and severity provided by CISA-ADP. This could result in an increase of up to 0.58% in the total number of reported Medium, High, or Critical vulnerabilities.

=== Addressed Issues

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|*Issue ID*
|*Description*

|CWP-
|*Azure*:

Serverless scanning. 

|CWP-
|*Red Hat*:

Added support for the epoch prefix in Red Hat images. Previously, the epoch was omitted during image scanning, causing version comparisons to ignore it and resulting in false positives. This fix ensures the epoch value is included, allowing accurate version comparisons and preventing incorrect vulnerability matches.

// === REST API Updates
// [cols="50%a,50%a"]
// |===

// |*Issue ID*
// |*Description*

// |CWP-61451
// |*Name and description field length limit fixed*:

// The character limit for the name field has been increased to a maximum of 300 characters, and the description field now supports up to 5,000 characters.
