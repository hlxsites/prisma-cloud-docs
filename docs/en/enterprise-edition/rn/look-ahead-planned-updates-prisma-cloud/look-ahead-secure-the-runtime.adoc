=== Addressed Issues

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===

|*Issue ID*
|*Description*

|CWP-63817
|*Azure Logic App functions*:

Serverless scanning is not supported for Azure Logic App functions. The issue where some scan results for Azure Logic App functions were included in the Monitor → Vulnerabilities → Functions tab is fixed. 

|CWP-63194
|*Red Hat VEX version compare issue fixed*:

Added support for the epoch prefix in Red Hat images. Previously, the epoch was omitted during image scanning, causing version comparisons to ignore it and resulting in false positives. This fix ensures the epoch value is included, allowing accurate version comparisons and preventing incorrect vulnerability matches.

|CWP-63808
|*Gateway Timeout while Loading Feeds fixed*:

Feed changed notifications to Defenders are now batched and spread to prevent 504 Gateway Timeout errors from concurrent downloads. Defenders also use Exponential Backoff with Jitter for retries.

|CWP-63880
|*Base Image History Tagging fixed*:

Scanning over 50 digests under one rule caused older base image digests to be deleted, removing base image links. The Base Image tag incorrectly remained under the Layers tab for these images. This has been fixed: the Base Image tag is now correctly removed from the Layers tab for images whose original base images were overridden.

|CWP-63341
|*Defender periodic scan fixed*:

You can now disable periodic scans for images, containers, and hosts by setting the scan interval to zero in *Manage* > *System* > *Scan Settings*.
