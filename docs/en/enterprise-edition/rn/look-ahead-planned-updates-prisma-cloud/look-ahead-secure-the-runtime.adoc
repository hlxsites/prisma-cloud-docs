[cols="30%a,70%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

// https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-58813
|*Disabling or skipping symbol extraction*

|When scanning Golang binaries, Prisma Cloud allows you to selectively disable symbol extraction or skip it for known non-vulnerable packages. This prevents out of memory (OOM) issues or reduces the number of packages, improving scan efficiency.

// https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-58812
|*Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) files in CycloneDX format*

|Prisma Cloud supports exporting Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) files in CycloneDX format for image, host, and serverless function scans.

// https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-58710
|*Improved Account Settings Management*

|Prisma CLoud allows you to edit account settings on the Accounts and Agentless page even when the account is disabled. This change makes it easier to modify the Agentless Scan settings, as previously, users had to first enable the account on the Prisma Account page to make changes.

// https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-57629
|*Changes in Agentless Scanning Configuration*

|When agentless scanning is enabled for existing accounts, scanning will no longer happen immediately. These accounts are included in the next periodic scan cycle, which occurs every 24 hours.

If agentless scanning is enabled for new onboarded accounts, it will trigger an immediate scan.

This enhancement prioritizes privacy and supports different scanning configurations.

   * https://pan.dev/compute/api/post-defenders-daemonset-yaml/[Generate Daemonset Deployment YAML File]

   * https://pan.dev/compute/api/post-defenders-helm-twistlock-defender-helm-tar-gz/[Generate a Helm Deployment Chart for Defender]
