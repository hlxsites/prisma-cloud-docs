[cols="30%a,70%a"]

|*Feature*
|*Description*

// https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-58813
|*Go Symbol Extraction*

|When scanning Golang binaries, Prisma Cloud now extracts Go symbols. This allows for accurate vulnerability evaluation with specific package names and symbols. Prisma Cloud also allows you to selectively disable symbol extraction, when it is not needed, to optimize the scan.

// https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-58812
|*Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Files in CycloneDX Format*

|Prisma Cloud supports exporting Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) files in CycloneDX format for image, host, and serverless function scans.

// https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-58710
|*Improved Account Settings Management*

|Prisma Cloud allows you to edit account settings on the Accounts and Agentless page even when the account is disabled. This change makes it easier to modify the Agentless Scan settings, as previously, you had to first enable the account on the Prisma Cloud Accounts page to make changes.

// https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-57629
|*Changes in Agentless Scanning Configuration*

|When agentless scanning is enabled for existing accounts, scanning will no longer happen immediately. These accounts are included in the next periodic scan cycle, which occurs every 24 hours.

If agentless scanning is enabled for new onboarded accounts, it will trigger an immediate scan.

This enhancement prioritizes privacy and supports different scanning configurations.

   * https://pan.dev/compute/api/post-defenders-helm-twistlock-defender-helm-tar-gz/[Generate a Helm Deployment Chart for Defender]
