|*Feature*
|*Description*

// https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-59337
//|*Support for Red Hat's VEX format*
//|Starting with Version 32, Update 7, Prisma Cloud will adopt the new Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) format for reporting Red Hat vulnerabilities. Red Hat will transition from the OVAL format to VEX by the end of 2024. 
//As a result of the new VEX format, Prisma Cloud's vulnerability detection and reporting behavior too will change. Beginning with Update 7, Prisma Cloud will report Red Hat vulnerabilities exclusively based on the source package.
//Customers must upgrade their Defender and console to the latest version to maintain a comprehensive view of Red Hat vulnerabilities under the new VEX format.
//The following screenshot shows the new reporting format.  
//image::vex-format-reporting.png[width=400]
//The vulnerabilities will be reported only for the glibc package, with references to its usage in glibc-devel, glibc-common, and glibc-headers. 
//Older Defenders on both the self-hosted and SaaS versions will experience a gap in reporting Red Hat vulnerabilities, because they do not extract the source packages for sub-projects. They will not report this vulnerability unless the sub-project name matches the source package name exactly, which is not common.
//In addition, the older consoles on the self-hosted version will no longer adjust the RH severity and CVSS scores, as the new RH data format is handled differently and only supported in Update 7 Console versions.

// https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-59772

|*Enhancement to Photon OS and Amazon Linux OS Feeds*

|Prisma Cloud now parses Photon OS and Amazon Linux OS feeds using CVE IDs as the primary vulnerability identifier instead of advisory IDs. This change enhances Prisma Cloud’s ability to correlate third-party data, and use vendor-provided information, including backports, severity assessments, and vulnerability scores.

// https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-57626

|*Support for Azure Container Registry and VM image scanning*

|Prisma Cloud now supports scanning Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Virtual Machine (VM) images for Azure cloud accounts that are onboarded directly through the platform.
