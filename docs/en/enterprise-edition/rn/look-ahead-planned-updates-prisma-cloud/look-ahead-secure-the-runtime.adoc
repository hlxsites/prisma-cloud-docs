=== Enhancements
[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===

|*Feature*
|*Description*

//CWP-64072 
|NVD score utilization and impact
|NVD traditionally provides two scores: a primary score from NIST and a secondary score from other sources. Previously, the secondary score was not used, even when the primary score was unavailable.

*Updated behavior*

* If the NVD primary score is missing and a CISA ADP secondary score is available, the secondary score will be used as the CVE score (for example,  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8671).
* Once the NVD primary score becomes available, it will revert to being the CVE score. 

*Note:* The secondary score is used only if the primary score is not available and the secondary score is based on a CISA-ADP evaluation.

*Impact on vulnerability reporting*

This improvement will lead to a change in how vulnerabilities are classified. Previously, vulnerabilities without a score, would be assigned a score of “0" and were categorized as "Low" severity. With this enhancement, they will now be assigned the CVSS and severity provided by CISA-ADP. This could result in an increase of up to 0.58% in the total number of reported Medium, High, or Critical vulnerabilities.


//CWP-63569 
|Account-level reporting of scan date and time
|The scan start and end date and time were earlier reported at the region level and were not precise in some situations. This enhancement ensures accurate reporting of scan start and end date and time at the individual account level.

//CWP-63936 
|Enhanced Alma Linux vulnerability assessment
|Vulnerability assessments for Alma Linux have significantly improved due to the integration of CVEs from Alma Linux security advisories (currently for releases 8 and 9) into the Intelligence Stream. This enhancement provides a more comprehensive and accurate picture of security risks, ultimately improving the security of Alma Linux 8 and 9 systems.
