// //Moved from Update 4
// | *Enhanced Vulnerability Assessment*

// |To enhance the accuracy of vulnerability assessments, Prisma Cloud has incorporated support for the 'Running On/With' configuration as outlined by NVD. This configuration, which integrates nodes based on both vulnerable and non-vulnerable criteria, requires specific conditions to be met, such as relevant packages or operating systems, for a vulnerability to be applicable. This enhancement allows Prisma Cloud to consider 'Running On/With' configurations that were not previously assessed. However, it is important to note that the impact of this enhancement is contingent on whether the CVE is assessed through NVD, as vulnerability information from the vendor feed is prioritized.

// //CWP-56785
// |*Serverless Defender support for Java 17 and 21*
// |Added support for deploying Serverless Defender on Java 17 and Java 21 runtimes.

// //CWP-56791 & CWP-56790 & CWP-56030
// // |*Exclude Windows vulnerabilities found in Go packages from UNIX OS*
// // |Prisma Cloud now excludes vulnerabilities found in Go packages that are specific to Windows from UNIX based operating systems in the Vulnerability Explorer. Select *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer* for a comprehensive list of the detected vulnerabilities.

// //CWP-57947
// //TODO:Approval Pending -- Kamesh
// |*Support for Google registry scanning*

// |When onboarding GCP cloud accounts, Prisma Cloud now supports scanning of Google Container Registry (GCR) and Google Artifact Registry (GAR).

// //CWP-56790 & CWP-56030
// //TODO:Approval Pending -- Kamesh
// |*OS-specific Evaluation for Go Packages*

// |Prisma Cloud now evaluates operating system (OS) data for vulnerabilities detected in Go packages. This enhancement ensures that vulnerabilities are reported only if they meet the OS-specific criteria. For example, if vulnerabilities are detected in Go packages that are specific to Windows, they are reported only for Windows-based systems. They are not flagged for UNIX-based systems.

// To view a detailed list of identified vulnerabilities, go to Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer.

// //CWP-56788
// //TODO:Approval Pending -- Kamesh
// |*New Console Environment Variable for system load management*

// |A new Console environment variable, REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS, has been added to prevent system overload issues when using the TAS applications with Defender.

// Previously, Defender checked the state of TAS applications and containers every 10 seconds through an API call to the BBS server. However, frequent changes or restarts in applications within this duration could lead to system overload as Defender scanned all the apps that were impacted by the changes.

// By setting a higher value for REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS, users can now reduce system load by decreasing the scanning frequency. For example, if REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS is set to 600 seconds, Defender checks for changes every 600 seconds, leading to a decrease in system load.

// NOTE: Restart Defender for the REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS environment variable to take effect.

// // CWP-56591
// // IMPORTANT: Not part of Update 5!!
// // |*Enhanced CVE Detection for Older JAR Versions*
// // |Fixed an issue where incorrect parsing of older JAR file versions resulted in missing CVE entries.

// //CWP-56784
// //TODO: Reviewd by Shlomi
// |*Improved Handling of Rejected and Disputed CVEs*
// |With the transition to the CVE 5.0 dataset, NVD has updated the format of rejected CVE descriptions.
// Prisma Cloud now seamlessly identifies 'Rejected' and 'Disputed' statuses of CVEs. In NVD the status is *now* labeled as 'Rejected reason', while CVEs tagged as 'Disputed' are identified using cve.org data source, ensuring accurate vulnerability assessment.

// //CWP-56554
// //TODO: Pending Approval -- Perhaps incorrect
// // |*Fixed Containerized Scan Failure*

// // |Resolved issue causing containerized scans to fail due to long JSON, particularly when encountering large Java dependency lists. You can now conduct scans without encountering this issue.

// //CWP-56788
// //TODO: Approval Pending -- Kamesh
// |*Defender fails to re-scan TAS applications after changes*

// |Previously, if modifications were done to a TAS application (such as renaming it), Defender would fail to re-scan the application and update the results in the Console. This issue has been resolved, and Defender now re-scans the TAS applications whenever changes are made to them.

// //CWP-56786
// //TODO:Approval Pending -- Kamesh
// |*Alpine Linux zlib not affected by CVE-2023-6992*

// |CVE-2023-6992 impacts the Cloudflare version of the zlib library. However, the zlib library included in Alpine Linux is not affected by this vulnerability. We have submitted a https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/15970[request] with Alpine Linux to add the CVE as a non-vulnerability for their zlib version.

// //CWP-58081
// //TODO:Approval Pending -- Kamesh
// |*Fix for Parsing Issues in Vulnerable Package Versions*

// |The fix resolves the following issues related to detection of vulnerable package versions: 

// * Correct parsing of vulnerable package versions.
// * Parsing of version ranges with different prefixes.
// * Handling of conditions for multiple versions to ensure they are added to the Intelligence feed. This resolves both false negative and false positive alerts.
