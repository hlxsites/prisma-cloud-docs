=== Description

This policy detects whether HTTPS URLs are used in the Ansible get_url module to ensure secure data transmission. Using HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted, providing confidentiality and integrity. It verifies that the tasks interact with URLs over a secure channel.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Ansible*

* *Module:* get_url
* *Attribute:* url

To align with this policy, make sure that all tasks using the `get_url` module specify URLs that start with "https://". This practice ensures that the data is transferred over an encrypted connection.

Secure Code Example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Example
  ansible.builtin.get_url:
    url: "https://example.com/file.tar.gz"
    dest: "/tmp/file.tar.gz"
----

In this example, by ensuring that URLs in your Ansible playbooks' get_url tasks start with 'https://', the security of your data transfer is enhanced.
