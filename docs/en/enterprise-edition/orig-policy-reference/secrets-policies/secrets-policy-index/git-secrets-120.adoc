=== Description

Exposing a Discord Webhook URL can lead to unauthorized access, spam, and misuse of your server. These URLs act as security endpoints, allowing external applications to send messages directly to your Discord channels.
To ensure the security of your Discord server, it's critical to manage your Webhook URLs securely and periodically review your security practices. For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook[Discord documentation and support].

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Discord*

Regenerate a new Webhook URL through your Discord account, replacing the exposed URL in all connected applications. This will prevent unauthorized access and ensure the security of your Discord server.

1. Log in to your Discord account and generate a new Webhook URL in the API section.
2. Replace the old Webhook URL with the new one in all your services and applications.
3. Deactivate the old Webhook URL once everything is updated and functioning.
4. Monitor systems closely after deactivation to ensure smooth operations and detect any unauthorized access attempts.

After updating the URL, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Discord Webhook to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
