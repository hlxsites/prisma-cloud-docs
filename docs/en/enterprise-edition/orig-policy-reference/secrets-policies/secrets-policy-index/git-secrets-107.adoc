=== Description

An OpenAI API Key is a secure and unique identifier used to authenticate requests to OpenAI's API services, including access to AI models for various applications. The API key ensures that only authorized users or applications can interact with OpenAI's services, facilitating the control and management of usage according to the specified terms and conditions. Exposed API keys can lead to exposed data and unplanned charges.

*OpenAI*

If your OpenAI API key is exposed, take immediate action to prevent further use by regenerating a new key through your OpenAI account. Replace the compromised key in all your applications and services with the newly generated one. This will ensure continued functionality while mitigating the security risks associated with the exposed key.

1. Log in to your OpenAI account.
2. Navigate to the API section in your account settings.
3. Find the API keys management page.
4. Select the option to generate a new API key.
5. Replace the compromised API key in your application or service with the new API key provided using a secure method that does not include hard coding the key in your code.

After those steps are completed, review API access and usage after replacing the API key to identify any unauthorized access or suspicious activities.

By generating a new API key and updating your application's configuration, you effectively invalidate the previous API key, preventing unauthorized use. It's crucial to replace the exposed key in all applications and services where it was used to ensure no disruption in accessing OpenAI's API services. Additionally, regularly reviewing and managing your API keys can help maintain the security of your applications. Always refer to OpenAI's official documentation for the most current guidance and best practices in managing API keys.
