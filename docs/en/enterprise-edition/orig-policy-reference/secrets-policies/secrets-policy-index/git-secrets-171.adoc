=== Description

The Docker Swarm Unlock Key is essential for unlocking encrypted data in Docker Swarm, ensuring the security and integrity of container orchestration. Exposing this key can lead to unauthorized access, allowing attackers to manipulate containers and services, potentially causing operational disruptions and data breaches. To secure your Docker Swarm environment, manage your Unlock Key carefully and regularly review security practices to prevent unauthorized access.
For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding Docker Swarm Unlock Key management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/manage-nodes/#unlock-a-swarm[Docker documentation and support].

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Docker Swarm*

Regenerate a new Unlock Key through your Docker Swarm management interface and replace the exposed key with the new key in all relevant configurations. this action secures your container orchestration environment and also maintains the confidentiality and integrity of your services.

1. Log into your Docker Swarm manager node with administrator credentials.

2. Generate a new Unlock Key: Run the `docker swarm unlock-key --rotate` command.

3. Save the new key securely and ensure it is not hardcoded in your source code or exposed in public repositories.

4. Update all relevant Docker Swarm configurations and services with the new Unlock Key values.

5. Ensure all nodes in the Docker Swarm are updated with the new Unlock Key to maintain synchronization and security.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent activities in your Docker Swarm environment to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
