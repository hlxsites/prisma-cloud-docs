=== Description

A Plaid access token is a sensitive credential that allows an application to access a user's financial data via the Plaid API. Exposing this token could allow unauthorized access to sensitive financial information, such as bank account details and transaction history.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Plaid*

To remediate the exposure of a Plaid access token, follow these steps:

1. Revoke the exposed token via the UI or https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#itemaccess_tokeninvalidate[API].
2. Generate a new access token with the appropriate scope and duration for your application's needs.
3. Monitor your account for abuse.

IMPORTANT: Review your codebase and configurations regularly for exposed secrets and follow security best practices to protect sensitive credentials.
