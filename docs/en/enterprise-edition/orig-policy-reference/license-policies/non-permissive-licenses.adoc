=== Description

Non Permissive licenses policies identify software packages distributed under non-permissive or restrictive licenses. These licenses restrict how you can use, modify, and distribute the software. They may limit your ability to integrate the software into certain projects or require you to purchase a commercial license for specific uses.

=== SPDX Identifiers

SPDX Identifiers are unique codes assigned to software licenses by the Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) project. In the context of Non Permissive License Policies, SPDX Identifiers are used to categorize and identify software packages distributed under non permissive licenses. These identifiers help in precisely identifying the licenses associated with the policies.


The following table lists SPDX identifiers falling under the Non Permissive Licenses Policies category.
