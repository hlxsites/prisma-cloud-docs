=== Description

Ths policy detects Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in JavaScript applications using the express framework, where user-provided inputs are inadequately sanitized. It scans DELETE requests in Express.js, where attackers could potentially exploit input fields (such as request parameters and user details) to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers when they interact with the compromised component.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,javascript]
----
const app = express()

app.delete('/deleteUser/:userId', (req, res, next) => {
  const userId = req.params.userId
  res.send(userId)
})
----

In this example, the code is vulnerable because it directly uses user-provided input req.params.userId without validation or sanitization. This leaves the code open to potential execution of harmful scripting code (Reflected XSS attacks) if the input is manipulated to include such code.


=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this vulnerability, validate and sanitize all user inputs. For example, consider using express-validator for validating user input on the server-side and DOMPurify for sanitizing output on the client-side.

Secure code example:

[source,javascript]
----
const app = express()
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator')
const createDOMPurify = require('dompurify')
const { JSDOM } = require('jsdom')
const window = (new JSDOM('')).window
const DOMPurify = createDOMPurify(window)

app.delete('/deleteUser/:userId', 
  body('userId').isInt(),
  (req, res, next) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req)
    if (!errors.isEmpty()){
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() })
    }
    const sanitizedUserId = DOMPurify.sanitize(req.params.userId)
    res.send(sanitizedUserId)
})
----

In this example, the code is protected against Reflected XSS attacks by validating the user-provided input as an integer and sanitizing it to neutralize any potential harmful scripts.
