=== Description

This policy checks whether Go's `net/http` serve functions are used without appropriately configured timeouts. Without timeouts, the server is vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks, where an attacker can open numerous connections without completing the data transmission or terminating the connections. This can lead to the server being unable to accept new connections.

In this example, the application uses `http.ListenAndServe` without setting appropriate timeouts, leaving it vulnerable to resource consumption attacks.


[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    // Insecure HTTP server without timeouts
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, configure the `http.Server` with appropriate timeouts. This limits connection durations and helps protect the server from resource consumption attacks.

In this example, the application configures the `ReadTimeout` and `ReadHeaderTimeout` parameters to enhance the security of the HTTP server.

[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Secure HTTP server with timeouts
    server := &http.Server{
        Addr:              ":8080",
        Handler:           nil,
        ReadTimeout:       10 * time.Second,
        ReadHeaderTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
    }
    server.ListenAndServe()
}
