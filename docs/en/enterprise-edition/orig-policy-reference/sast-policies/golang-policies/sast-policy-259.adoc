=== Description

This checks whether Go's built-in profiling service is used by detecting imports of `net/http/pprof`. The `/debug/pprof` endpoint, enabled by this import, lacks authentication and can be accessed by anonymous users, which could potentially expose sensitive information.

In this example, the application imports `net/http/pprof`. This enables the profiling endpoint, potentially exposing sensitive information.


[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    _ "net/http/pprof"
)

func main() {
    // Insecure use of profiling endpoint
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, remove the import of `net/http/pprof` to prevent the profiling endpoint from being enabled in production environments, thus reducing the risk of sensitive information leakage.

In this example, the import of `net/http/pprof` is removed to enhance the security of the application.

[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    // Secure application without profiling endpoint
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
