=== Description

This policy checks whether Go applications set excessive file permissions using io/ioutil.WriteFile. Permissions greater than 0600 can expose files to unauthorized access.

In this example, the application sets excessive file permissions using ioutil.WriteFile with a mask greater than 0600. This could potentially expose the file to unauthorized access.


[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Insecure file permissions
    data := []byte("Sensitive data")
    err := ioutil.WriteFile("/path/to/file", data, 0666)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, apply more restrictive file permissions when writing files. This ensures that access is limited to only the necessary users. Recommended permissions include `0200` for write-only access, `0400` for read-only access, or `0600` for read/write access by the application user only.

In this example, the application configures the file permissions to `0600`, ensuring that only the application user has access.

package main

import (
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Secure file permissions
    data := []byte("Sensitive data")
    err := ioutil.WriteFile("/path/to/file", data, 0600)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
