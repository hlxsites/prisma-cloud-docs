=== Description

This policy checks whether Go applications mount the root directory / to an HTTP handler function, exposing the entire filesystem. This potentially allows anyone with access to the HTTP server to access any file that the server has access to.

In the following code snippet, the application mounts the root directory `/` to an HTTP handler, which can expose the entire filesystem to external parties.

[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    // Insecure use of root directory in HTTP handler
    fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("/"))
    http.Handle("/", fs)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, restrict the `http.Dir` path to a specific folder rather than the entire filesystem. This confines file exposure to only those within the designated directory, enhancing security by minimizing access to sensitive files.

In this example, the application restricts the `http.Dir` path to a specific folder.

[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    // Secure use of specific directory in HTTP handler
    fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("/path/to/specific/folder"))
    http.Handle("/", fs)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
