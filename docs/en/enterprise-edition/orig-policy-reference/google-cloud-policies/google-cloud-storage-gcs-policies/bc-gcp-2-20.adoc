=== Description

This policy is checking to ensure that a MySQL DB instance has a point-in-time recovery backup configured. Point-in-time recovery allows you to restore your database to any second during your retention period, up to the last five minutes. Not having this setup can be risky as it might result in data loss if there is an issue or outage. By not using point-in-time recovery backup, you are potentially putting your data at risk in the event of a disaster or data corruption issue. Therefore, it's crucial to have this backup configuration in place to safeguard your data.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* google_sql_database_instance
* *Arguments:* database_version, settings.backup_configuration.binary_log_enabled

To fix this, you need to enable Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) in your MySQL DB instance. Please ensure the `backup_window` and `backup_retention_period` attributes are configured optimally. Here's some example code:

[source,hcl]
----
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "default" {
  name             = "mysql-instance"
  region           = "us-central1"
  database_version = "MYSQL_5_6"

  settings {
    tier  = "db-f1-micro"

    backup_configuration {
      enabled            = true
+     binary_log_enabled = true
      start_time         = "05:00" // specify a convenient time
    }
  }

  backup_window {
    start_time = "05:00"
  }

  backup_retention_period = 30
}
----

In the above example, we've enabled backups by setting `enabled` to `true` under `backup_configuration`. `binary_log_enabled` is also set to `true` to ensure binary logging (necessary for point-in-time recovery) is enabled. The `start_time` attribute is set to schedule the backup at a specific time. Also, `backup_retention_period` has been set to `30` days to hold backups.
