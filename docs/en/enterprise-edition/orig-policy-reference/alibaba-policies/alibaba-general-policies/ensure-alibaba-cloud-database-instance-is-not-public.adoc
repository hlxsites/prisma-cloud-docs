=== Description 


Public database instances are vulnerable, as attackers can use a variety of techniques to gain unauthorized access to public databases, such as SQL injection attacks, brute-force attacks, or exploiting misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the database software. To prevent this risk, make the database instance private by restricting access to only authorized users.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*

To mitigate this issue, ensure the `security_ips` parameter in the `alicloud_db_instance` resource does not include "0.0.0.0" or "0.0.0.0/0". Specify a restricted range of IP addresses that are authorized to access the database.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_db_instance" "example" {
  ...
  security_ips = [
-    "0.0.0.0/0"
+    "10.0.0.0/16"
  ]
}
----
