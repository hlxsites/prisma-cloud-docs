=== Description 

Including secrets in a `.npmrc` file can expose them to attackers who have gained unauthorized access to the repository, allowing them to use those secrets to access protected resources.

For example, an attacker could use a secret that is used in a proxy configuration, such as the proxy or https-proxy keys, to access a proxy server and then use the proxy server to access restricted organization assets, such as an internal package registry.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

When exposed secrets are found it is recommended to:

* Rotate the exposed secret
* Replace the secret with an environment variable placeholder as detailed in NPM’s documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/using-private-packages-in-a-ci-cd-workflow
