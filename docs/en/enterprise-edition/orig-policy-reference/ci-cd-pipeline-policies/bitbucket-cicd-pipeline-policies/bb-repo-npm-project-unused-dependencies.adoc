=== Description

NPM dependencies can potentially execute code during installation. Each added dependency expands the attack surface. Unused dependencies elevate the risk, as they unnecessarily widen the attack surface of a project without valid justification.

An unused and compromised dependency exposes the project to unnecessary risks, potentially allowing malicious code to run on developers' endpoints, during build, or in production. 


=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

It is recommended to remove unused dependencies from a project: Run `npm uninstall <package_name>`.
