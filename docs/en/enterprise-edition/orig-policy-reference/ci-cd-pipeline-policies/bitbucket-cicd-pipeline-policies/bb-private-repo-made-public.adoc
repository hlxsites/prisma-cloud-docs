=== Description 

A private repository made public allows anyone to access the source code in the repository and to retrieve hard-coded credentials and potentially sensitive information. An attacker may also be able to perform a Public-PPE (3PE) attack and reach the production environment.

For more on 3PE refer to https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/prisma-cloud/poisoned-pipeline-execution-deep-dive/.

Note that the severity of this risk is reduced on self-hosted instances that are not accessible over the internet.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Verify the reason for changing the repositoryâ€™s visibility. If necessary, revert the repository visibility back to 'private'. For more information refer to https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-repository-privacy-and-forking-options/.
