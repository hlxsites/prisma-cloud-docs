=== Description

When a pull request is approved, it means that the code changes have been reviewed and can be merged into the target branch. However, new commits added to an existing pull request after it has been approved do not automatically require review. This can result in the bypassing of branch protection rules, allowing the merging of unreviewed commits into the default branch, potentially introducing malicious code that could be used to steal secrets, establish backdoors, and affect production.


=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

It is recommended to configure branch protection rules to dismiss pull request approvals when new commits are pushed. We advise configuring these settings at the project level to establish a secure default for both existing repositories without an existing branch protection rule as well as for new repositories.

NOTE: Project level settings don't automatically enforce or override existing repository level settings. To apply project-level settings across all repositories, existing repository-level settings must be manually modified or reset.

==== Project-level configuration

1. Browse to the project *Settings* > under *Repos*, click *Repositories*.
2. Select *Policies* and click on the default branch.
3. Under *Require a minimum number of reviewers* enable *When new changes are pushed*.
4. Enable *Reset all approval votes*.

===== Repository-level configuration

1. Browse to the project *Settings* > under *Repos*, click *Repositories*.
2. Select the relevant repository, then under *Branch Policies* click on the default branch.
3. Under *Require a minimum number of reviewers*, enable *When new changes are pushed*.
4. Enable *Reset all approval votes*.
