=== Description

This policy detects whether Azure Container Instances (ACI) are configured with a virtual network. When ACIs are not deployed within a virtual network, they become publicly accessible, creating a security risk as they are directly exposed to the internet. To mitigate this risk, it is strongly recommended to configure all your container instances within a virtual network. By doing so, you establish a secure and isolated environment where your containers can communicate securely with other resources within the virtual network, preventing potential unauthorized access.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_container_group
* *Arguments:* ip_address_type

To remediate this issue, set the `ip_address_type`` attribute to Private or None in your Terraform configuration.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "azurerm_container_group" "example" {
  ...
-  ip_address_type = "Public"
+  ip_address_type = "Private"
}
----
