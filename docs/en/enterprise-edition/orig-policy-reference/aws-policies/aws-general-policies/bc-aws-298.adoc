=== Description

This policy is checking to ensure that the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) S3 is utilizing a Customer Managed Key (CMK) for encryption. If this policy is not adhered to, it could potentially create a security risk as AWS managed keys may not provide the same level of control and access restrictions that a CMK would. This could leave sensitive data exposed or vulnerable to unauthorized access or breaches.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_dms_s3_endpoint
* *Arguments:* kms_key_arn

To fix this issue, you need to set the "kms_key_arn" attribute in your DMS S3 configuration block.

[source,hcl]
----
resource "aws_dms_s3_endpoint" "test_dms_endpoint_s3" {
+ kms_key_arn     = "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef"
  ...
}
----

The above Terraform code is secure because by adding kms_key_arn parameter with the value of the ARN of the Customer Managed Key, you ensure that a Customer Managed Key is used with DMS S3. This allows you to have more granular control over data encryption and decryption.
