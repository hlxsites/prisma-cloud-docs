=== Description

This policy is checking to ensure that a Redshift Serverless namespace in AWS is encrypted using a customer managed key (CMK) provided by Key Management Service (KMS). This is crucial because encryption adds an additional layer of security to protect data. A customer-managed key offers more flexibility and control over the cryptographic keys, including the ability to implement key rotation, disable, or delete a key. If Redshift Serverless namespaces are not encrypted by a CMK, it implies that default AWS managed keys are being used or data is not encrypted, which can increase the risk of unauthorized data access or breaches.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_redshiftserverless_namespace
* *Arguments:* kms_key_id

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that your Redshift Serverless namespace is using encryption by a customer-managed key.

[source,go]

resource "aws_redshiftserverless_namespace" "pass" {
  namespace_name = "test-pass-namespace"
+ kms_key_id = aws_kms_key.example.arn
