=== Impact
Traffic of the Jenkins instance is sent over an unencrypted layer. An attacker can perform a man-in-the-mMiddle attack to collect sensitive information, such as credentials or application code, or to modify the data sent to/from the instance to perform malicious actions.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Encrypt all data in transit, flowing to and from the Jenkins instance. Follow best practices when implementing the HTTPS protocol: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.html
