=== Description 

GitHub does not display a Verified Badge for the organization because the domain name associated with it has not been verified.

Verifying a domain name with GitHub provides an additional layer of integrity to your organization by displaying a Verified Badge on the organizationâ€™s profile, building trust and confidence both inside and outside of the organization.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Ensure that your organization verifies its domain name. 

For more information on how to approve your domains refer to https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-enterprise.
