=== Description 

Unpinned GitHub Actions are mutable, potentially allowing attackers with access to the actionâ€™s repository to push a malicious version of the action, thereby introducing poisoned code which can be executed in the pipeline in order to access stored secrets or to read or modify the source code. 

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

GitHub recommends pinning actions to a full length commit SHA, as this is currently the only method of using an action as an immutable release.
