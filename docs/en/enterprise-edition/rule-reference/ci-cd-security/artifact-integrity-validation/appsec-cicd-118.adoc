=== Description 

Auto-merge logic in pipelines is usually executed when conditions that check for minor changes in the code are met. These conditions may potentially contain flaws, allowing attackers with "write" access to take advantage of them in order to bypass pull request reviews and to merge malicious code to protected branches.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

We recommend removing auto-merge logic from pipelines.
