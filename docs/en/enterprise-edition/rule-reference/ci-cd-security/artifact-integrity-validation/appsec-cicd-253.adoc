=== Description

Docker containers used without digests are mutable, which may cause a security risk. Attackers with access to the container registry could potentially replace the image with a malicious version, introducing malicious code. 
This code might be executed in the pipeline using this container image to access secrets available in the pipeline, and read or modify the associated repository's source code.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Docker allows referencing the container image using a digest in the following manner: `image@sha256:<digest>`.
To get the digest you want to use, visit the Docker container registry or invoke the docker `pull [image]` command which will print the digest of the pulled image.

For example, referring the official Ubuntu image using its digest: `ubuntu:20.04@sha256:1871b9d0f55b07c1f1962f0405920567f4c820401a049173921b4f031d39673b`.

For more information refer to the Docker documentation: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/#pull-an-image-by-digest-immutable-identifier.
