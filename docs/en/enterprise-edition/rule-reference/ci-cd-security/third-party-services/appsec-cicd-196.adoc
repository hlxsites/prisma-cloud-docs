=== Description 

Volatile or development orbs are mutable, as they can be overwritten by new versions.

Malicious actors who gain control of the registry will be able to push a malicious orb with an existing version. The orb will be pulled automatically by the pipeline, leading to code execution in the pipeline. 

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

It is recommended to use immutable production orbs which follow *semver* (semantic versioning) [Major].[Minor].[Patch], as they cannot be deleted or edited.

For additional information, refer to: https://circleci.com/docs/orb-concepts/#semantic-versioning.
