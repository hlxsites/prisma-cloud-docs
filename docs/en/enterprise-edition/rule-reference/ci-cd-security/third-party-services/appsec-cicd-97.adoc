=== Description 

A GitHub App with **write** permissions to an organization that has not performed any actions requiring write permissions for more than 30 days may not require these permissions. This poses a threat, as attackers who gain control of the GitHub App can potentially access the organization and its repositories, thereby enlarging the surface of the attack.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

If the GitHub App is not in use, delete the app from the organization.
If the app is in use, but is not using its granted write permissions, consider asking the app creator to reduce the requested permissions to **readâ€™** 

NOTE: App creators, not organization admins, control the level of permission granted to GitHub Apps.
