=== Description 

GitLab pipeline jobs are assigned a token that enables authenticating to specific GitLab API endpoints - see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html.

The token is assigned with the same permissions as the user who triggered the pipeline job. The token scope can be limited to the current project, or to any project accessible by the user account. 

An unlimited token can allow attackers to misuse permissions granted by the token scope and expand their attack to target any projects accessible by the user.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Limit pipeline job token scope:
 
. Browse to the project **Settings**.
. Under **CI/CD**, expand **Token Access** and enable the **Limit CI_JOB_TOKEN access** setting.
