=== Description 

Forking is permitted on private repositories within an organization, enabling users with 'read' permissions to fork a repository to another organization or user account.

This could lead to a decrease in security as SAML SSO may not be mandatory for authentication when accessing a forked repository.

Another security concern is that pull requests can be generated from forked repositories, which may result in a https://www.cidersecurity.io/top-10-cicd-security-risks/poisoned-pipeline-execution-ppe/[PPE attack].

It is recommended to prevent forking of repositories at the highest possible level (organization or enterprise, as applicable). Refer to the following instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-forking-policy-for-your-organization.
