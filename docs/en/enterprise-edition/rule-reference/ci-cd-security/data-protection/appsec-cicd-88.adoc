=== Description 

A private repository made public allows anyone to access the source code in the repository and to retrieve hard-coded credentials and potentially sensitive information.
An attacker may also be able to perform a Public-PPE (3PE) attack and reach the production environment.
For more on 3PE see https://www.cidersecurity.io/top-10-cicd-security-risks/poisoned-pipeline-execution-ppe/.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Verify the reason for changing the repository’s visibility. If necessary, revert the repository visibility back to “private”. For more refer to 
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#changing-a-repositorys-visibility
