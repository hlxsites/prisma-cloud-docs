=== Impact
SSL verification is disabled for an organization webhook, which instructs GitHub to not verify the identity of the remote server.
The lack of verification can enable attackers to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, and to expose the transmitted data.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

To enable SSL Verification for a webhook:
 
. Browse to the organization **Settings**.
. Under **Webhooks**, select the relevant webhook.
. Check the **Enable SSL verification** setting.
