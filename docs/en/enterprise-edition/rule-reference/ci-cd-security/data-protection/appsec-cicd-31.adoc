=== Impact
User accounts with **write** permissions can force push to a default branch of an actively used repository^*^ and overwrite the commit history. If the repository is not stored on another source, a malicious user account can permanently delete the entire git history of the repository.

^*^An actively used repository has at least two contributors, over 50 commits, and was updated in the last 90 days.


=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

To restrict force push on the default branch:

. Browse to the repository **Settings**.

. Under **Branches**, edit the rule that applies to the repository default branch.

. Uncheck the **Allow force pushes** setting.
