=== Description 

SSL verification is disabled for a project webhook, resulting in GitLab not verifying the identity of the remote server.

The lack of verification can enable attackers to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, and to expose the transmitted data.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Enable SSL Verification for the webhook:
 
. Browse to the project **Settings**.
. Under **Webhooks**, select the relevant webhook, and select **Edit**.
. Check the **Enable SSL verification** setting.
