=== Description 

Removing code reviews from protected branches eliminates an essential security measure designed to prevent unreviewed code that may contain security bugs and/or malicious commits being pushed to repository branches.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Verify the reason for removing required reviews.
Consider adding a branch protection rule with the **Require a pull request before merging** setting enabled, and selecting at least 1 reviewer in the **Require approvals** field.
