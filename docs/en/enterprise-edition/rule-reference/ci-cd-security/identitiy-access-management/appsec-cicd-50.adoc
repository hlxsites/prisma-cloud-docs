=== Impact
Anonymous visitors with network access to the Jenkins instance have read access to the instance without being required to authenticate, allowing anonymous attackers to expose information on the instance, such as console outputs of executed jobs, job names, dredential IDs, registered users and available nodes.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Prevent anonymous visitors from having read access on the Jenkins instance.
 
. On the Jenkins instance, under **Manage Jenkins**, browse to **Configure Global Security**.
. Under **Authorization**, uncheck the **Allow anonymous read access** checkbox.
