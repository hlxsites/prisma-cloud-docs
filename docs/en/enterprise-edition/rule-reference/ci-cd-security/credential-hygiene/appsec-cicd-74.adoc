=== Description 

GitLab CI/CD environment variables in projects and groups can be scoped to project environments in order to limit access of pipelines to them. Sensitive variables that are not scoped can be accessed by insecure pipelines (for example, on test environments), without proper controls on accessing these variables.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

To limit a variable scope:
 
. Browse to the relevant project or group **Settings**.
. Under **CI/CD**, expand **Variables**.
. Edit the environment variable and assign it to an environment scope.
