=== Impact
The *.npmrc* file is a configuration file used by npm, the Node Package Manager, to manage settings and options related to package installation and publishing. Failing to store the '.npmrc' file in the repository can make the project vulnerable during pipelines to both dependency confusion, by allowing an internal package to be fetched from the public registry, as well as insecure use of credentials.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Create a *.npmrc* file in the repository and configure it according to the best practices detailed in the npm documentation: 

* Authentication related configurations must be scoped to a specific registry by prefixing with a URI fragment: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/npmrc#auth-related-configuration

* Use a variable to represent tokens used in the '.npmrc' file: https://docs.npmjs.com/using-private-packages-in-a-ci-cd-workflow
