=== Description

NPM packages can be installed using a URL of a git repository, which may contain a reference to a branch, tag or commit hash. Without using a commit hash reference, the integrity of the downloaded package cannot be guaranteed. This can result in developers or build servers inadvertently downloading a different version of the package than intended, which could potentially contain malicious code. This could expose both the development and production environments to risks.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Pin the package URL:

. Uninstall the downloaded NPM package: Execute `npm uninstall <package>`.
. Reinstall the package with a commit hash reference: Run `npm install <github_url>`.
