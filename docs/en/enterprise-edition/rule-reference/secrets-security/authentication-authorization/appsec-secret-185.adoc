=== Impact
Eventbrite OAuth 2.0 keys are sensitive credentials used for authentication and authorization in applications integrating with Eventbrite services. Exposing these keys can result in unauthorized access to user data and compromise the security of your application and user accounts.

=== How to Fix

*Eventbrite*

Eventbrite does not allow rotation for OAuth2 keys via the UI. Instead, remove the integration and create a new one.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Eventbrite OAuth2 keys to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
