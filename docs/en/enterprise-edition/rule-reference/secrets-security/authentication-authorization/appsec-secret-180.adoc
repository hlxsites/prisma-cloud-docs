=== Description

The Okta Client Secret is essential for authenticating applications and services in OAuth and OpenID Connect flows. Exposing this secret can lead to unauthorized access, allowing malicious actors to exploit authentication mechanisms and potentially compromise sensitive data and services. To safeguard your Okta integration, manage your Client Secret securely and regularly review your security practices to prevent unauthorized access.
For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding Okta Client Secret management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/main/[Okta documentation and support].

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Okta*

Regenerate a new secret through your Okta account and replace the exposed secret with the new secret in all relevant applications. This action secures your authentication mechanisms and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your services.

1. Log into your Okta account with administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the 'Applications' section and select the affected application.

3. Identify the exposed Client Secret and regenerate a new secret.
NOTE: Ensure that regenerating your secret does not disrupt any applications or services.

4. Save the new secret securely and ensure it is not hardcoded in your source code or exposed in public repositories.

5. Update all applications and services that use the Okta Client Secret with the new secret values.

After updating the secret, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Okta Client Secret to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
