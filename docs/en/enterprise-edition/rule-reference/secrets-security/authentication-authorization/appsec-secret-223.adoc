=== Description

Storing SSH passwords directly in your code is extremely risky. If this code is committed to a repository or shared, it allows anyone with access to the code to potentially gain unauthorized access to your servers. 

=== Fix - Buildtime

*SSH*

1. Add a server-side revocation list configured to deny access to exposed secrets.
2. Create a new password for applications and users that used them.

Continuously monitor server logs and security alerts for unusual login attempts or access patterns, which could indicate attempts to exploit compromised keys or credentials.
