=== Impact
Slack bot tokens are sensitive credentials that grant access to your Slack workspace. If a Slack bot token is exposed, unauthorized individuals could potentially use it to access and manipulate your Slack workspace, including sending messages, accessing files, and even inviting new users.

=== How to Fix

*Slack*

If you've identified a Slack bot token in your code, follow these steps to address the issue:

1. Immediately revoke the compromised token from your Slack workspace settings or via the https://api.slack.com/methods/auth.revoke[API]. This will prevent further unauthorized access.
2. Create a new bot token for your Slack app, ensuring you follow Slack's best practices for security.
3. Avoid hardcoding the new token directly in your code. Instead, use a secure storage mechanism like environment variables or a secrets management solution.

Regularly audit your codebase and configurations for exposed secrets and leverage automated security scanning tools to help identify and mitigate these risks proactively.
