=== Impact
Yahoo OAuth 2.0 keys are sensitive credentials used for authentication and authorization in applications integrating with Yahoo services. Exposing these keys can result in unauthorized access to user data and compromise the security of your application and user accounts.

=== How to Fix

*Yahoo*

If your Yahoo OAuth2 keys are exposed, rotate them immediately.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Yahoo OAuth2 Keys to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
