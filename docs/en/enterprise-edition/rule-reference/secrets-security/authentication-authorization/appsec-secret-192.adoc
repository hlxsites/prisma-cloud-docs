=== Impact
A Bearer Token is an essential credential used in token-based authentication schemes to access various services and APIs. Exposing this token can lead to unauthorized access, enabling malicious actors to exploit your services and potentially causing severe operational disruptions and data breaches. To safeguard your integrations, manage your Bearer Tokens securely and regularly review your security practices to prevent unauthorized access.
For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding Bearer Token management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/[OAuth documentation and support].

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Bearer Token*

Revoke the compromised token through your authentication provider and generate a new token to replace the exposed one in all relevant applications. This action secures your services and maintains the confidentiality and integrity of your data flows.

1. Log into your authentication provider with administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the 'Tokens' or 'API Keys' section within your account settings.

3. Identify the exposed token and revoke it.
NOTE: Ensure that revoking your token does not disrupt any critical services.

4. Generate a new Bearer Token using your application's option to generate keys. Save the new token securely and ensure it is not hardcoded in your source code or exposed in public repositories.

5. Update all applications and services that use the Bearer Token with the new token values.

After updating the token, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Bearer Token to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
