=== Impact
The reCAPTCHA key acts as a critical security component for protecting websites against bots and automated abuse. It helps to ensure that interactions with your site are performed by humans rather than automated scripts. Exposing the reCAPTCHA key can lead to unauthorized use, rendering the reCAPTCHA system ineffective and potentially allowing malicious actors to bypass security measures. To maintain the integrity of your reCAPTCHA implementation, it is essential to manage your reCAPTCHA keys securely and regularly review your security practices to prevent any unauthorized usage. For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding reCAPTCHA key management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://developers.google.com/recaptcha[Google reCAPTCHA documentation and support].

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Google Developer*

Regenerate a new key in your reCAPTCHA account and replace the compromised key across all applications. This action secures your website interactions and maintains the integrity of your security measures.

1. Log into your Google Developer console.

2. Navigate to the 'Admin Console' section of the reCAPTCHA section and select the affected site.

3. Identify the exposed key and delete it.
NOTE: Ensure that you do not break any applications when deleting the key.

4. Generate a new reCAPTCHA key: Select 'Create new key', provide the necessary information, and save the changes.

5. Update all applications and services that use the reCAPTCHA key with the new key values, ensuring the new key is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the reCAPTCHA key to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
