=== Impact
ReadMe offers a managed service for maintaining a documentation site.
Each documentation site that you publish on ReadMe is a project.
Within a project there is space for documentation, interactive API reference guides, a changelog, and many more features.
Each project within your account is published separately.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Readme If one of your API keys has been leaked or if you have any security concerns about a particular API key, we strongly recommend you rotate out your API keys.* 


You can do so by taking the following steps:
* Delete the exposed API key in your dashboard (there is a Delete option if you click the three dots on the right-hand side)
* The "Edit" and "Delete" options that are available when you click the three dots on the right-hand side of an API key
* Re-generate a new API key in its place
* Replace any usage of the leaked API key with the new one
