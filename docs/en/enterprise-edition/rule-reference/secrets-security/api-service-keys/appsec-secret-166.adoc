=== Impact
The Stripe Webhook Secret is a critical credential used to verify the integrity and authenticity of webhook events sent by Stripe to your server, ensuring they haven't been tampered with. Exposing this secret can lead to unauthorized access and misuse of your Stripe account, including potential manipulation of transactions and financial data. To secure your Stripe integration, manage your Webhook Secret carefully and regularly review security practices to prevent unauthorized access.
For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding Stripe Webhook Secret management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures[Stripe documentation and support].

=== How to Fix

*Stripe*

Regenerate a new Stripe Webhook Secret through your Stripe account and replace the exposed secret across all relevant applications. This actions secures your Stripe webhook events and also helps maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your financial transactions.

1. Log into your Stripe account with administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=%2Fwebhooks[dashboard section] and select 'Webhooks'.

3. Identify the affected webhook endpoint and delete the compromised secret.
NOTE: Ensure that deleting your secret does not disrupt any transactions or services by thoroughly testing and monitoring.

4. Add a new webhook endpoint to generate a new secret.

5. Update all applications and services that use the Stripe Webhook Secret with the new secret values, ensuring the new secret is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the secret, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Stripe Webhook Secret to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
