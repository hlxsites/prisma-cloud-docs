=== Description 


The Notion API uses bearer tokens to authorize requests from integrations.
As an integration developer, you'll need to choose the appropriate integration type for the integration you create.
Based on the integration type, you'll receive and store bearer tokens differently.
For both types, an integration must send the bearer token in the HTTP Authorization request header.
