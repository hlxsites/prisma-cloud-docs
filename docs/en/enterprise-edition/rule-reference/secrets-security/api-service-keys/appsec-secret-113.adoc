If your MonkeyLearn API key is exposed, itâ€™s crucial to take immediate action to prevent any unauthorized use. Regenerate a new key through your MonkeyLearn account and replace the exposed key with the new key in all relevant applications. By regenerating a compromised MonkeyLearn API Key and updating your application integrations, you not only secure your access to MonkeyLearn AI services but also maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your data flows.

1. Log into your MonkeyLearn account with administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the 'API Keys' section within your account settings.

3. Identify the exposed key and delete it.
NOTE: Ensure that deleting your key does not break any applications.

4. Select 'Create new key' to generate a new API Key. Provide a name for the new key and save the changes.

5. Update all applications and services that use the MonkeyLearn API Key with the new key values, ensuring the new key is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the MonkeyLearn API Key to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and strengthen your security measures.
