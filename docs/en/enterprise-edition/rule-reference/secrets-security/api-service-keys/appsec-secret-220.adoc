=== Impact
Grafana service account tokens are sensitive credentials used to authenticate and authorize access to Grafana resources. Exposing these tokens can lead to unauthorized access to your Grafana instance, dashboards, and data sources, potentially allowing attackers to steal sensitive information, manipulate data, or disrupt your monitoring capabilities. See the https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/service-accounts/[Grafana documentation for more details].

=== How to Fix

*Grafana*

To mitigate the risk of exposed Grafana service account tokens, follow these steps:

1. Immediately revoke the compromised token from your Grafana server. This will prevent further unauthorized access using the exposed credentials.
2. Create a new service account token with appropriate permissions for the intended use case. 
3. Replace the exposed token with the newly generated one in all configurations, scripts, or applications that require access to your Grafana instance.

After rotating the token, it is recommended to audit all recent access logs for any suspicious activity and review the permissions granted to the service account to ensure they are still appropriate.
