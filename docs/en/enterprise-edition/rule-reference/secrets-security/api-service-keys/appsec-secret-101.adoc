=== Impact
A Square Access Token is used to authenticate requests made to the Square API. This token is tied to your Square account and gives you access to various services provided by Square, such as transaction processing, inventory management, and customer management. Access Tokens are secret keys that must be kept secure as they can grant significant access to your Square account and resources.


=== How to Fix


*Square*

To revoke a Square Access Token:

1. Log in to the Square Developer Dashboard.
2. Navigate to your application.
3. Go to the 'Credentials' tab.
4. Under the 'Access Token' section, click 'Revoke' next to the token you wish to revoke.
5. Confirm the revocation when prompted.
+
This will immediately invalidate the Access Token, and it can no longer be used for API access. If you need to continue accessing the Square API, generate a new token and replace the old one in your application. Be cautious with this action, as it might disrupt services depending on this token. Always test changes in a safe environment before updating production systems.
