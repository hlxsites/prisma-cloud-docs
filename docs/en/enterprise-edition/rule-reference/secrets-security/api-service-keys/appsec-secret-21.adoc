=== Impact
Airtable is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet.
The fields in an Airtable table are similar to cells in a spreadsheet, but have types such as 'checkbox', 'phone number', and 'drop-down list', and can reference file attachments like images.
Users can create a database, set up column types, add records, link tables to one another, collaborate, sort records and publish views to external websites.
The Airtable Airtable API key allows users to use our public API to create, fetch, update, and delete records in the bases you have access to in Airtable.
API keys follow the same permissions that an account has in the Airtable UI.
