=== Description

Exposing a Zapier webhook URL in your code is risky. Unauthorized individuals could discover this URL and trigger actions in your Zapier integrations, potentially causing unintended consequences or data manipulation. 

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Zapier*

To mitigate the risks associated with exposed Zapier webhook URLs, follow these steps:

1. If you suspect your Zapier webhook URL has been compromised, regenerate it from your Zapier account. This will invalidate the old URL.
2. Implement authentication or verification mechanisms within your application's webhook handling logic to ensure that requests originating from the webhook URL are legitimate.
