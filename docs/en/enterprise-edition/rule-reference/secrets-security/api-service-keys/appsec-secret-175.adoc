=== Description

The Zillow Key is a critical credential used to access Zillow's API services, enabling applications to retrieve real estate data such as property details, listings, and valuations. Exposing this key can lead to unauthorized access, misuse of the API, and potential data leaks. To maintain the security of your Zillow integration, it is essential to manage your Zillow Key securely and regularly review your security practices to prevent any unauthorized usage.
For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding Zillow Key management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm[Zillow documentation and support].

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Zillow*

Regenerate a new key through your Zillow account and replace the exposed key with the new key in all relevant applications. This action secures your access to Zillow API services and also maintains the confidentiality and integrity of your data flows.

1. Log into your Zillow account with administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the 'API Keys' section within your account settings.

3. Identify the exposed key and delete it.
NOTE: Ensure that deleting your key does not disrupt any applications or services.

4. Generate a new Zillow Key: Select 'Create new key', provide the necessary information and save the changes.

5. Update all applications and services that use the Zillow Key with the new key values, ensuring the new key is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Zillow Key to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
