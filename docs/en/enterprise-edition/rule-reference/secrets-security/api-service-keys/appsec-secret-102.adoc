=== Impact
A Square Application Secret, also known as a Secret Key, is a secure key that is used to authenticate your application when it makes server-to-server API calls to Square. This key should never be exposed publicly, and it should only be stored securely on your server. It's critical to keep this key secret, as it can grant full access to your Square account's resources, including the ability to process transactions.


=== How to Fix


*Square*

You cannot directly revoke a Square Application Secret. However, if your Secret Key is compromised, Square recommends that you create a new application, which will generate a new set of Application ID and Application Secret. Then, you should migrate all usage to the new application, and once you are sure that the old application is not being used anymore, you can delete it.
