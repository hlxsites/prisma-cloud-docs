=== Impact
RapidAPI is used to find, test, and connect to thousands of APIs -- all with a single API key and dashboard.
It allows finding APIs, embedding them into an app and tracking usage of all endpoints.
To connect an API to a project or application, you must have an API key to authenticate your request.
Creating an app within RapidAPI generates an API key (X-RapidAPI-Key) specific to that application.
You can view analytics based on the API calls you make using this app key.
