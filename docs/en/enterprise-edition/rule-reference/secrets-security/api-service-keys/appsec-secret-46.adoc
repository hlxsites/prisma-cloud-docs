=== Impact
The Grafana API key is a randomly generated string that external systems use to interact with Grafana HTTP APIs.
When you create an API key, you specify a Role that determines the permissions associated with the API key.
Role permissions control that actions the API key can perform on Grafana resources.

=== How to Fix


*Grafana `DELETE /api/auth/keys/:id`*
