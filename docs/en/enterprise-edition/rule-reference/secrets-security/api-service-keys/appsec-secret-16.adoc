=== Impact
The Square OAuth API uses the OAuth 2 protocol to get permission from the owner of the seller account to manage specific types of resources in that account.

=== How to Fix


*Square* 



.  Revoke the exposed secret.
+
`POST /oauth2/revoke`: Revokes an access token generated with the OAuth flow.
+
If an account has more than one OAuth access token for your application, this endpoint revokes all of them, regardless of which token you specify.
+
When an OAuth access token is revoked, all of the active subscriptions associated with that OAuth token are canceled immediately.
+
Replace APPLICATION_SECRET with the application secret on the OAuth page in the developer dashboard.
