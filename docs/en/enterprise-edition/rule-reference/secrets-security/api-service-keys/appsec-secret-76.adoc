=== Description 


Scalr is a remote operations backend for Terraform.
It executes Terraform operations and stores state, regardless of the workflow, in Scalr itself allowing for easy collaboration across your organization.
That means you can easily onboard an existing GitOps or native Terraform CLI based workflows into Scalr with little to no modification to your actual code.
