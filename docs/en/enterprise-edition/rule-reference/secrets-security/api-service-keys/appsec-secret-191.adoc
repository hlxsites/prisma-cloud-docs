=== Impact
The Octopus Deploy API Key is a critical credential for accessing Octopus Deploy's deployment automation services. Exposing this key can result in unauthorized access, allowing malicious actors to manipulate your deployment processes and potentially cause severe disruptions and data breaches. To safeguard your Octopus Deploy integration, manage your API Key securely, and regularly review your security practices to prevent unauthorized access.
For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding Octopus Deploy API Key management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://octopus.com/docs/octopus-rest-api[Octopus Deploy documentation and support].

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Octopus Deploy*

Regenerate a new key through your Octopus Deploy account and replace the exposed key with the new key in all relevant applications. This action secures your deployment processes and maintains the confidentiality and integrity of your services.

1. Log into your Octopus Deploy account with administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the 'My API Keys' section within your user settings.

3. Identify the exposed key and delete it.
NOTE: Ensure that deleting your key does not disrupt any applications or services by monitoring pipelines for disruption.

4. Generate a new Octopus Deploy API Key: generate a new Octopus Deploy API key, provide the necessary information, and save the changes.

5. Update all applications and services that use the Octopus Deploy API Key with the new key values, ensuring the new key is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Octopus Deploy API Key to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
