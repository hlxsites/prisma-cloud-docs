=== Description 


The PagerDuty REST API supports authenticating via an account or user API token.
Account API tokens have access to all of the data on an account, and can either be granted read-only access or full access to read, write, update, and delete.
For PagerDuty accounts with Advanced Permissions, user API tokens have access to all of the data that the associated user account has access to.
Only account administrators have the ability to generate account API tokens.
