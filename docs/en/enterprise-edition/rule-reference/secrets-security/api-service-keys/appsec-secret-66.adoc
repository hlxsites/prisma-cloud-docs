=== Impact
Splunk's Credential Management page enables storing credentials for scripted or modular inputs.
Input configurations that reference credentials can use the credentials stored in Credential Management.
Developers can store credentials such as usernames and passwords, or certificates used for authentication with third-party systems.
It is discouraged to use this page to manage certificates used to encrypt server-to-server communications.

=== How to Fix


*Splunk* 



. On the Enterprise Security menu bar, select Configure > General > Credential Management.

. In the Action column of a credential or certificate, click Delete.

. Click OK to confirm.
