. If you have the Create Access Keys role capability, you can use the Preferences page to create access keys.
+
You can use the Preferences page to edit, activate, deactivate, and delete your access keys.

. When you mouse over an access key on the Preferences page, several controls appear.

. Use the trash can icon to permanently remove the access key.
+
The key will no longer be usable for API calls.
+
However, deleting a key used to register a Collector does not affect the Collector, as the only time a Collector uses the access key is at installation.
