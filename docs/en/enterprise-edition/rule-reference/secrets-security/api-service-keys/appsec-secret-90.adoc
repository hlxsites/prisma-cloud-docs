=== Description

Shopify uses API access tokens to authenticate requests to its API. When a store installs your app, these tokens are typically obtained via OAuth and are used to make authenticated requests on behalf of a specific Shopify store. This access token should be kept confidential as it allows significant access to a store's data.

*Shopify*

To revoke an access token:

1. Navigate to the admin section of your Shopify store.
2. Click on 'Apps'.
3. Click on the name of the app that you want to uninstall.
4. Click on 'Delete' to uninstall the app.

Uninstalling the app will revoke the access token. For specifics about your situation, or if Shopify's systems have changed after the last update, you should refer to the official Shopify documentation or reach out to Shopify's support.
