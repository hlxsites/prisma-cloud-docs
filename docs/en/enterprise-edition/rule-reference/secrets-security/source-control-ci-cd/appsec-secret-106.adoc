=== Impact
A Clojars Deploy Token is a unique identifier used for authentication when deploying or publishing artifacts to the Clojars repository. Clojars is a community-driven repository for Clojure libraries and dependencies. The deploy token allows authorized individuals to securely upload and manage their Clojure packages.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Clojars*

Clojars does not provide a built-in method to directly revoke a deploy token. However, you can regenerate a new deploy token to invalidate the old one. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Clojars account.
2. Navigate to your account settings or profile.
3. Look for the section related to authentication tokens or deploy tokens.
4. Generate a new deploy token.
5. Replace the old deploy token in your build or deployment configuration with the newly generated one.
+
By generating a new token and updating your configuration, the previous deploy token is effectively revoked as it becomes invalid. Always consult the latest Clojars documentation for any specific changes or recommendations regarding managing deploy tokens.
