=== Impact
The NPM access token can be used to authenticate to npm when using the API or the npm command-line interface (CLI).
An access token is a hexadecimal string that you can use to authenticate, and which gives you the right to install and/or publish your modules.

=== How to Fix


*NPM* 



.  Revoke Secret.

----
npm token list
