=== Description 


When a Vault server is started, it starts in a sealed state.
In this state, Vault is configured to know where and how to access the physical storage, but doesn't know how to decrypt any of it.
Unsealing is the process of obtaining the plaintext root key necessary to read the decryption key to decrypt the data, allowing access to the Vault.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Vault* 



.  Revoke the key

. Connect to Vault

. Run `vault operator key revoke` followed by the number, such as `vault operator key revoke 2`

. Verify it was revoked with `vault operator key status`

.  Monitor for abuse
