=== Description 


To authenticate to and access Databricks REST APIs, you can use Databricks personal access tokens or passwords.
Databricks strongly recommends that you use tokens.
Tokens replace passwords in an authentication flow and should be protected like passwords.

To protect tokens, Databricks recommends that you store tokens in:

* Secret management and retrieve tokens in notebooks using the Secrets utility (dbutils.secrets).
* A local key store and use the Python keyring package to retrieve tokens at runtime.
