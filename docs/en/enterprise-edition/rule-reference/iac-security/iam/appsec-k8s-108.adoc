=== Impact
Use individual service account credentials for each controller.
The controller manager creates a service account per controller in the kube-system namespace, generates a credential for it, and builds a dedicated API client with that service account credential for each controller loop to use.
Setting the --use-service-account- credentials to true runs each control loop within the controller manager using a separate service account credential.
When used in combination with RBAC, this ensures that the control loops run with the minimum permissions required to perform their intended tasks.

=== Fix - Buildtime
