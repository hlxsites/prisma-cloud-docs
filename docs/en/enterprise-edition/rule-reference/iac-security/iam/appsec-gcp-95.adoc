=== Impact
https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/auth-overview[AUTH] is an optional security feature on Memorystore for Redis that requires incoming connections to authenticate with an AUTH string.
Every AUTH string is a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), and each Redis instance with AUTH enabled has a unique AUTH string.
When you enable the AUTH feature on your Memorystore instance, incoming client connections must authenticate in order to connect.
Once a client authenticates with an AUTH string, it remains authenticated for the lifetime of that connection, even if you change the AUTH string.
We recommend that you enble AUTH on your Memorystore for Redis database to protect against unwanted or non-approved connections.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_redis_instance
* *Field:* auth_enabled


[source,go]
----
{
 "resource "google_redis_instance" "cache" {
  name           = "memory-cache"
  display_name   = "memory cache db"
  tier           = "STANDARD_HA"
  memory_size_gb = 1

- auth_enabled = false
+ auth_enabled = true",
 
}
