== OCI private keys are hard coded in the provider misconfiguration detected in code


=== Rule Details

[cols="1,2"]

|Cortex AppSec Rule ID |APPSEC_OCI_1
|Category |IAM - Credential Exposure
|Provider |Oracle

|Mapped CSPM/KSPM Rule |None
|===


=== Impact
When accessing OCI programmatically, users can use a password protected certificate.
Including that password in your files that are checked into a repository leaves you exposed to account hijacking.
We recommend using a secrets store or security tokens for secure access.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform*
