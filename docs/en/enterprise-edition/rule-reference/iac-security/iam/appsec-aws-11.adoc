=== Impact
Password policies are used to enforce the creation and use of password complexity.
Your IAM password policy should be set for passwords to require the inclusion of different character types.
The password policy should enforce passwords contain at least one lowercase letter, this increases security, especially from a brute force attack.

=== How to Fix
