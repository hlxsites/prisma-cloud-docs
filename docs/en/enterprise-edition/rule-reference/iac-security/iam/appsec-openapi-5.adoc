=== Impact
If security schemes are not defined in OpenAPI Security Objects for Operations, the API may be exposed without proper authentication, which could lead to unauthorized access. This could result in security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to gain access to sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. 



=== How to Fix

*OpenAPI* 




Ensure that you have an authentication type in the security section of your path.
For example:

[source,yaml]
----
paths:
  "/":
    get:
      operationId: id
      summary: example
-     security: []
+     security:
+       - OAuth2:
+           - write
----
