=== Description 


It is recommended to set a password for the administrative user (root by default) to prevent unauthorized access to the SQL database instances.
This recommendation is applicable only for MySQL Instances.
PostgreSQL does not offer any setting for No Password from the cloud console.
At the time of MySQL Instance creation, not providing an administrative password allows anyone to connect to the SQL database instance with administrative privileges.
The root password should be set to ensure only authorized users have these privileges.
