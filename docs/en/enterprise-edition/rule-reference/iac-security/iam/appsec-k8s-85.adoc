=== Description 


Limit the `Node` and `Pod` objects that a kubelet could modify.
Using the `NodeRestriction` plug-in ensures that the kubelet is restricted to the `Node` and ``Pod ``objects that it could modify as defined.
Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own `Node` API object, and only modify `Pod` API objects that are bound to their node.

=== Fix - Buildtime
