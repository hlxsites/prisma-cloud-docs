=== Description 


Cluster Administrators should leverage G Suite Groups and Cloud IAM to assign Kubernetes user roles to a collection of users, instead of to individual emails using only Cloud IAM.
On- and off-boarding users is often difficult to automate and prone to error.
Using a single source of truth for user permissions via G Suite Groups reduces the number of locations that an individual must be off-boarded from, and prevents users gaining unique permissions sets that increase the cost of audit.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_container_cluster
* *Arguments:* authenticator_groups_config.security_group


[source,go]
----
resource "google_container_cluster" "example" {
  name               = var.name
  location           = var.location
  project            = data.google_project.project.name
  
+ authenticator_groups_config{
+   security_group="gke-security-groups@yourdomain.com"
+ }
