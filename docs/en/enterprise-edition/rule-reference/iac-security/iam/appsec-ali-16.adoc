=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

* *Resource:* alicloud_ram_account_password_policy
* *Arguments:* max_password_age

To mitigate this issue, ensure the `max_password_age` attribute in the `alicloud_ram_account_password_policy` resource is set to a value between 1 and 90.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_ram_account_password_policy" "example" {
  ...
-  max_password_age             = 180
+  max_password_age             = 45
}
----
