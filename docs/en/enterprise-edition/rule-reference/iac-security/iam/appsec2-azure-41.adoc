=== Description

This policy identifies Azure Storage accounts not configured with SAS expiration policy.

A Shared Access Signature (SAS) expiration policy specifies a recommended interval over which the SAS is valid. SAS expiration policies apply to a service SAS or an account SAS. When a user generates service SAS or an account SAS with a validity interval that is larger than the recommended interval, they'll see a warning. If Azure Storage logging with Azure Monitor is enabled, then an entry is written to the Azure Storage logs. It is recommended that you limit the interval for a SAS in case it is compromised.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_storage_account
* *Arguments:* shared_access_key_enabled, sas_policy.expiration_period

To mitigate this issue, implement one of the following options:
 
* Set the `shared_access_key_enabled` attribute in the `azurerm_storage_account` resource to 'false'
* Configure a `sas_policy` with a defined `expiration_period` if the `shared_access_key_enabled` attribute is set to 'true'


Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  ...
  shared_access_key_enabled = true

+  sas_policy {
+    expiration_period = "01.12:00:00"
+  }
}
----
