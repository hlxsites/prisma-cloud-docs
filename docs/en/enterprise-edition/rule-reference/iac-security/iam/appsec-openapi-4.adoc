== OpenAPI Security object needs to have defined rules in its array and rules should be defined in the securityScheme misconfiguration detected in code

=== Impact
OpenAPI uses security schemes to reference authentication and authorization schemes.
Your APIs should have authentication schemes in place and documented in the OpenAPI specification, as well as applied to individual operations or the entire API in the security details.

=== How to Fix


*OpenAPI* 


Ensure that you have a securityScheme component and application.
For example:
[source,yaml]

components:
security:
