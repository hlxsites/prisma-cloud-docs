=== Impact
This policy identifies Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI) accounts that do not have a symbol in the password policy for local (non-federated) users.
As a security best practice, configure a strong password policy for secure access to the OCI console.


=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* oci_identity_authentication_policy
* *Arguments:*  password_policy.is_special_characters_required


[source,go]
----
resource "oci_identity_authentication_policy" "pass" {

  compartment_id = var.tenancy_id

  password_policy {
    ...
    is_special_characters_required   = true
    ...
  }
}
