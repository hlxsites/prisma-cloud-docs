=== Description 

This policy identifies IAM policies attached to user. By default, IAM users, groups, and roles have no access to AWS resources. IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is recommended that IAM policies be applied directly to groups but not users.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*

To fix this issue, ensure that IAM policies are not directly attached to users. Instead, attach the policies to groups or roles.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "fail" {
  name       = "example"
  policy_arn = "aws_iam_policy.policy.arn"

-  users = ["example"]
}
----


*CloudFormation* 


* *Resource:* AWS::IAM::Policy
* *Arguments:* Properties.Users


[source,yaml]
----
{
 "Resources:
  ExamplePolicy:
    Type: 'AWS::IAM::Policy'
    Properties:
      ...
-     Users:
-       - example_user",
}
----
