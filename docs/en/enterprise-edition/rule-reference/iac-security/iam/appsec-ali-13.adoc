*Terraform* 

* *Resource:* alicloud_ram_account_password_policy
* *Arguments:* minimum_password_length

To mitigate this issue, ensure the `minimum_password_length` attribute in the `alicloud_ram_account_password_policy` resource is set to 14 or higher.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_ram_account_password_policy" "example" {
  ...
+  minimum_password_length      = 15
}
----
