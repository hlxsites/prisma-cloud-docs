*Terraform*

* *Resource:* alicloud_ram_account_password_policy
* *Arguments:* require_numbers

To mitigate this issue, ensure the `require_numbers` attribute in the `alicloud_ram_account_password_policy` resource is set to `true`.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_ram_account_password_policy" "example" {
  ...
+  require_numbers    = true
}
----
