=== Impact
Ensuring that your Amazon Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key is enabled is important because it determines whether the key can be used to perform cryptographic operations.
When a key is enabled, it can be used to encrypt, decrypt, and generate data keys.
When it is disabled, it cannot be used for these operations.
