=== Impact
In GitLab, administrators can turn on the capability to require signed commits for a project.
When you enable required commit signing on a branch, contributors and bots can only push commits that have been signed and verified to the branch.
If a collaborator pushes an unsigned commit to a branch that requires commit signatures, the collaborator will need to rebase the commit to include a verified signature, then force push the rewritten commit to the branch.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* Resource: gitlab_project
* Attribute: prevent_secrets


[source,go]
----
resource "gitlab_project" "example-two" {
...
  push_rules {
    ...
+    reject_unsigned_commits        = true
  }
}
