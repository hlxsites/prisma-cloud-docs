=== Description 


Enable kubelet client certificate rotation.
The --rotate-certificates setting causes the kubelet to rotate its client certificates by creating new CSRs as its existing credentials expire.
This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there is no downtime due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad.

NOTE: This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g.Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself.
