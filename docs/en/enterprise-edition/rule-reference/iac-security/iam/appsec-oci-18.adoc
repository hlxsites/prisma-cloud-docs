=== Impact
This rule identifies Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI) accounts that do not have a minimum of 14 characters in the password rule for local (non-federated) users.
As a security best practice, configure a strong password policy for secure access to the OCI console.


=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* oci_identity_authentication_policy
* *Arguments:* password_policy.minimum_password_length


[source,go]
----
resource "oci_identity_authentication_policy" "pass" {

  compartment_id = var.tenancy_id

  password_policy {
...
    minimum_password_length          = 14
  }
}
