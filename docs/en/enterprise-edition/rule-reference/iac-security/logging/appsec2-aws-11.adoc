=== Description 


VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
After you have created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
VPC Flow Logs provide visibility into network traffic that traverses the VPC.
We recommend that VPC Flow Logs are enabled for packet Rejects for VPCs to help detect anomalous traffic and insight during security workflows.
