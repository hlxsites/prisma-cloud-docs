=== Description 


AWS Config is a web service that performs configuration management of supported AWS resources within your account and delivers log files to you.
AWS config uses configuration recorder to detect changes in your resource configurations and capture these changes as configuration items.
It continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.
This policy generates alerts when AWS Config recorder is not enabled.
