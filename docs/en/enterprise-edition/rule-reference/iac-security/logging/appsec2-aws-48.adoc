=== Impact
This rule identifies resources for which AWS Config recording is enabled but recording for all possible resources are disabled.
AWS Config provides an inventory of your AWS resources and a history of configuration changes to these resources.
You can use AWS Config to define rules that evaluate these configurations for compliance.
Hence, it is important to enable this feature.

=== How to Fix

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_config_configuration_recorder" "pass_recorder" {
  name     = "example"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.r.arn

  recording_group {
    include_global_resource_types = true
  }

}

resource "aws_config_configuration_recorder_status" "pass" {
  name       = aws_config_configuration_recorder.pass_recorder.name
  is_enabled = true
}
