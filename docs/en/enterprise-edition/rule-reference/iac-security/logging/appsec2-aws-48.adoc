=== Impact
This policy identifies resources for which AWS Config recording is enabled but recording for all possible resources are disabled.
AWS Config provides an inventory of your AWS resources and a history of configuration changes to these resources.
You can use AWS Config to define rules that evaluate these configurations for compliance.
Hence, it is important to enable this feature.
