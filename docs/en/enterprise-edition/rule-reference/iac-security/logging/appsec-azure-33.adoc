=== Impact
The *Azure Queue Storage* service stores messages that may be read by any client with access to the storage account.
A queue may contain an unlimited number of messages, each of which can be up to 64KB in size when using version 2011-08-18 or newer.
*Storage Logging* takes place server-side recording details in the storage account for both successful and failed requests.
These logs allow users to see the details of read, write, and delete operations against the queues.
*Storage Logging* log entries contain the following information about individual requests: timing information, for example start time, end-to-end latency, server latency, authentication details, concurrency information, and the size of request and response messages.
*Storage Analytics* logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service.
This information can be used to monitor individual requests and to diagnose issues with a storage service.
Requests are logged on a best-effort basis.
*Storage Analytics* logging is not enabled by default for your storage account.
=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* azurerm_storage_account
* *Arguments:* logging + hour_metrics + minute_metrics


[source,go]
----
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
    name                     = "example"
    resource_group_name      = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.name
    location                 = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.location
    account_tier             = "Standard"
    account_replication_type = "GRS"
    queue_properties  {
+   logging {
        delete                = true
        read                  = true
        write                 = true
        version               = "1.0"
        retention_policy_days = 10
    }
  }
}
----

The *logging* field should be enough to enable logging.
As Terraform apply might fail, it is recommended to also configure the *hour_metrics* and *minute_metrics* fields.


[source,go]
----
+   hour_metrics {
        enabled               = true
        include_apis          = true
        version               = "1.0"
        retention_policy_days = 10
    }
+   minute_metrics {
        enabled               = true
        include_apis          = true
        version               = "1.0"
        retention_policy_days = 10
    }
