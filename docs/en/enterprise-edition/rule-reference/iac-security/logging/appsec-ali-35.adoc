=== Description

This policy ensures that the `log_duration` parameter is enabled for Alibaba Cloud RDS instances. Enabling this parameter helps log the duration of each completed statement, providing valuable insights into query performance and execution time. This data is critical for monitoring database performance and identifying slow queries.

Failing to enable this parameter can limit visibility into query execution metrics, making it difficult to diagnose performance issues and optimize database operations.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* alicloud_rds_instance
* *Arguments:* log_duration

To mitigate this issue, ensure the `log_duration` parameter is set to `on` in the RDS instance configuration.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_rds_instance" "example" {
  ...

  parameter {
+    name  = "log_duration"
+    value = "on"
  }
}
----
