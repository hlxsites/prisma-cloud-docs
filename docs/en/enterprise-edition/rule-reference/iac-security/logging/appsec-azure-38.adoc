=== Impact
A log profile controls how the activity log is exported.
Configuring the log profile to collect logs for the categories *Write*, *Delete* and *Action* ensures that all control/management plane activities performed on the subscription are exported.
We recommend you configure the log profile to export all activities from the control/management plane.

=== How to Fix
