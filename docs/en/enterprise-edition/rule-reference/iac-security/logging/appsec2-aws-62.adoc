=== Description

This policy detects if the S3 bucket event notifications are not enabled in AWS settings.

=== Fix - Buildtime
                
*Terraform*
                
* *Resource:* aws_s3_bucket, aws_s3_bucket_notification
* *Arguments:* queue, lambda_function, topic

The issue can be fixed by enabling event notifications for the S3 bucket. You can do it by using the `aws_s3_bucket_notification` resource where you can specify the type of destination (Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, or AWS Lambda) where you want Amazon S3 to publish the event.

Secure code example:

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "bucket"
}

resource "aws_sns_topic" "bucket_notifications" {
  name = "bucket-notifications"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_notification" "bucket_notification" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.bucket.id

  topic {
    topic_arn     = aws_sns_topic.bucket_notifications.arn
    events        = ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"]
    filter_prefix = "logs/"
  }
}
----

The above code is secure as it enables event notifications for the S3 bucket and specifies Amazon SNS as the destination where Amazon S3 will publish the event.
