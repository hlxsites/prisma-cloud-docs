=== Description

This policy detects whether plain-text management HTTP is enabled for Interface Management Profiles in Palo Alto Networks devices. HTTP lacks encryption, therefore enabling HTTP for management purposes exposes the device to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized access.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Palo Alto Networks*

* *Resource:* panos_management_profile
* *Attribute:* http

To mitigate this risk, ensure that the http attribute in the panos_management_profile resource is not set to 'true'. If this attribute is necessary, it should be explicitly set to 'false', thereby disabling plain-text HTTP and promoting secure management practices.

Secure Code Example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Example
  hosts: all
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Example
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_management_profile:
        provider: '{{ provider }}'
        name: 'Test profile'
-        http: true # http defined as true, which is a fail
+        http: false # http defined as true, which is a fail
----

In this example, the `http` attribute is set to false or omitting it in the management profile configuration disables plain-text HTTP, and enhances the security posture of the Palo Alto Networks device.
