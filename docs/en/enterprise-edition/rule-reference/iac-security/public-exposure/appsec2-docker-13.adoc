=== Description 

Configuring NPM with the command `npm config set strict-ssl false` within Dockerfiles is deemed insecure. This command directs NPM (Node Package Manager) to forego SSL certificate verification during its interactions with registries or other network-based transactions.

When strict SSL for NPM is disabled, it heightens the risk of man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Such attacks involve unauthorized actors potentially intercepting, altering, or eavesdropping on the communications between the Node.js application and the NPM registry or other servers. This can facilitate unintended code injections, data breaches, or the installation of malicious packages.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Docker*
