=== Description 


The *auto_create_network* setting in a Google Cloud Project controls whether a default network is automatically created for the project. 
Having a default network in place can pose security risks as it may not conform to the organization's custom networking and security requirements. 
To improve the security posture of your Google Cloud environment, it's recommended to disable the automatic creation of a default network. 
This allows for the manual setup of a network that aligns with specific security policies and configurations. 


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_project
* *Argument:* auto_create_network

By setting *auto_create_network* to *false*, you ensure that no default network is created, enabling more granular control over the networking environment of your Google Cloud Project.
