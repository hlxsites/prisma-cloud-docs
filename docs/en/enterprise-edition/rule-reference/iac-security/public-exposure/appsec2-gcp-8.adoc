=== Description 


GCP Cloud KMS key rings contain your encryption keys, and allowing anonymous or public access to a key ring grants permissions for anyone to access the cryptokeys stored inside the ring.
CryptoKeys should only be accessed by trusted parties because they are commonly used to protect sensitive data.
We recommend you ensure anonymous and public access to KMS key rings is not allowed.

=== Fix - Runtime


* GCP Console* 


To change the policy using the GCP Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/security/kms/keyrings [Key Management].

. On the * Key Rings* details page, select your _key ring_.

. Click the * SHOW INFO PANEL* side bar.

. To remove a specific role assignment, to the front of * allUsers* and * allAuthenticatedUsers*, click * Delete*.


* CLI Command* 


To remove access to * allUsers* and * allAuthenticatedUsers*, use the following command:
----
gcloud kms keyrings remove-iam-policy-binding KEY-RING \
--location LOCATION \
--member PRINCIPAL \
--role roles/ROLE-NAME
----
Replace * KEY-RING* with the name of the key ring.
Replace * LOCATION* with the location of the key ring.
Replace * PRINCIPAL* with either * allUsers* or * allAuthenticatedUsers*.
Replace * ROLE-NAME* with the name of the role to remove.
