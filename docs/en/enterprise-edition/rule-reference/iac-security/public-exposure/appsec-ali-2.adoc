=== Description 

This policy identifies Security groups that allow inbound traffic on SSH port (22) from the public internet. As a best practice, restrict security groups to only allow permitted traffic and limit brute force attacks on your network.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

* *Resource:* alicloud_security_group_rule
* *Attribute:* cidr_ip

To mitigate this issue, ensure that the `cidr_ip` attribute in the `alicloud_security_group_rule` resource does not include `0.0.0.0/0` for ingress on port 22.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_security_group_rule" "example" {
  ...
  type = "ingress"
  ip_protocol = "tcp"
  port_range = "22/22"
-  cidr_ip = "0.0.0.0/0"
+  cidr_ip = "192.168.1.0/24"
}
----
