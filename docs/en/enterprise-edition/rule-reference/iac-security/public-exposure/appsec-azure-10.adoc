=== Description 


A potential security problem using SSH over the Internet is that attackers can use various brute force techniques to gain access to Azure Virtual Machines.
Once the attackers gain access, they can use a virtual machine as a launch point for compromising other machines on the Azure Virtual Network.
The attackers could also access and attack networked devices outside of Azure.
We recommend you disable SSH access over the internet to Network Security Groups.
