=== Impact
This rule detects whether the `apt`` (Advanced Package Tool) command is used within Dockerfile RUN instructions. We recommend that you do not run the `apt`` command within Dockerfiles, due to potential instability and security vulnerabilities.


=== Fix - Buildtime

*Docker*

Replace `apt`` with `apt-get`` for package management within Dockerfile RUN commands.

In the example below, `apt` is replaced with `apt-get` to ensures a more reliable and secure package installation process.

[source,dockerfile]
----
# Bad example
RUN apt update && apt install -y nginx

# Good example
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
