=== Impact
This rule identifies the OCI Virtual Cloud Networks (VCN) that lack ingress rules configured in their security lists.
It is recommended that Virtual Cloud Networks (VCN) security lists are configured with ingress rules which provide stateful and stateless firewall capability to control network access to your instances.


=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* oci_core_security_list
* *Arguments:* vcn_id + ingress_security_rules


[source,go]
----
resource "oci_core_security_list" "pass" {
    compartment_id = oci_identity_compartment.tf-compartment.id
    vcn_id = oci_core_vcn.test_vcn.id
+    ingress_security_rules {
+        protocol = "all"
+        source="192.168.1.0/24"
+    }
}
