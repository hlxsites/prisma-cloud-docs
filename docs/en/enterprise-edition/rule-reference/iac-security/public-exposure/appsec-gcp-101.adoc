== GCP Artifact Registry repositories are anonymously or publicly accessible misconfiguration detected in code

*Artifact Registry* is a service that stores artifacts and build dependencies for your GCP applications.
Artifact registry repositories can contain sensitive credentials that are baked into containers, personal data (like PII), or confidential data that you may not want publicly accessible.
Repositories can be made anonymously or publicly accessible via IAM policies containing the IAM members _allUsers_ or _allAuthenticatedUsers_.
We recommend you ensure that neither anonymous or public access to *Artifact Registry repositories* is allowed.
