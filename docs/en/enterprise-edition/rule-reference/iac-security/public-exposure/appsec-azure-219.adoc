=== Description

This policy verifies whether a firewall policy has been defined on the Azure platform. Not adhering to this policy could potentially expose a network to unauthorized access. This is dangerous because without a firewall policy, there aren't any rules that check the incoming and outgoing network traffic. As a result, this can potentially allow malicious users to access or disrupt services within the network. Hence, it is crucial to define a firewall policy to enhance security and protect the integrity of the network.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_firewall
* *Arguments:* firewall_policy_id

To fix this issue, you need to define and associate a firewall policy with your Azure Firewall.
