=== Description

This policy looks into the security definitions in OpenAPI 2.0 files to ensure that security scopes for operations are properly defined. If they are not properly defined, it could lead to insecure API endpoints, potentially leaving the application vulnerable to unauthorized access or breaches. This could result in unauthorized data access, manipulation, or even system takeover, hence it's crucial to ensure each operation has been mapped with the correct security scope.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*OpenAPI*

To fix this issue in your OpenAPI (Swagger) file, define security scopes that allow you to set the level of access for each API operation. Specifically, include each security scope within the `securityDefinition` block.

[source,yaml]
----
securityDefinitions:
  my_oauth:
    type: oauth2
    scopes:
      'read:stuff': Read access to the stuff
      'write:stuff': Write access to the stuff
    flow: implicit
    authorizationUrl: https://oauth.example.com/authorize
----

In the above code, `my_oauth` defines an OAuth security scheme where 'read:stuff' and 'write:stuff' are the specific scopes. The 'read:stuff' and 'write:stuff' scopes indicate the actions that can be performed when a user is granted these permissions. This structure ensures that API consumers understand what specific authorizations are required to access each operation. This is a strong practice in securing your API as it provides granularity in access control for each operation in your API specification.
