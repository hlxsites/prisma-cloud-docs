== GCP Cloud Run services are anonymously or publicly accessible

Cloud Run services are fully managed serverless environments used to develop and deploy containerized applications.
In GCP, Cloud Run services support a wide variety of authentication methods to execute (invoke) the container.
One of those methods is based to the usage of two special IAM principals: _allUsers_ and _allAuthenticatedUsers_.
When those IAM principals have access to the Cloud Run service - anyone on the internet can execute or access the Cloud Run service.
We recommend you ensure that neither anonymous or public access to Cloud Run services are allowed.

To remove anonymous or public access to your Cloud Run service execute the following command:


[source,shell]
----
{
 "gcloud run services remove-iam-policy-binding SERVICE-NAME \\
    --member=MEMBER-TYPE \\
    --role=ROLE",
