=== Impact
*SSL connectivity* provides a new layer of security by connecting a database server to client applications using a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
Enforcing SSL connections between a database server and client applications helps protect against _man-in-the-middle_ attacks.
This is achieved by encrypting the data stream between the server and application.
We recommend you set *Enforce SSL connection* to** Enable** on PostgreSQL Server databases.
