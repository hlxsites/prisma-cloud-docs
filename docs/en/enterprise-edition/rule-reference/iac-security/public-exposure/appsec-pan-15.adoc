=== Description

This policy detects whether an 'Include ACL' (Access Control List) is defined when User-ID is enabled on a security zone in Palo Alto Networks devices. User-ID is a feature that maps IP addresses to users, allowing for policy enforcement based on user identity. When User-ID is enabled, the 'Include ACL' specifies which traffic should be included for user mapping. If the 'Include ACL' property is not defined, User-ID might incorrectly process or exclude important traffic.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Palo Alto Networks*

* *Resource:* panos_zone
* *Attributes:* enable_userid, include_acl

To mitigate this risk, ensure that for each panos_zone where enable_userid attribute is 'true', there is a corresponding include_acl attribute that is non-empty. The 'Include ACL' should specify the traffic to be included in the User-ID mapping process, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of user-based policies.

Secure Code Example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Example
  ...
  tasks:
    - name: Zone
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_zone:
        ...
        enable_userid: true
        include_acl: ['10.0.200.0/24']
----

In this example, by defining an 'Include ACL' for zones where User-ID is enabled, you ensure that user identification is accurately applied to the correct set of traffic.
