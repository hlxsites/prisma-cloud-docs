=== Description 


By ensuring that function apps are only accessible over HTTPS, you can help to protect the data transmitted to and from your app from being accessed or modified by unauthorized parties.
This can help to improve the security of your app and protect it from potential threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks or data breaches.
