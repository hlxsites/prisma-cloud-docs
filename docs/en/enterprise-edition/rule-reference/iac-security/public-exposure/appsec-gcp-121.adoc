=== Description

This policy (CKV_GCP_121) is looking to confirm that deletion protection is enabled for all BigQuery tables in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment. The reason this is important is because tables without deletion protection can be deleted either accidentally or maliciously. In both cases, valuable data could be permanently lost. By ensuring deletion protection is enabled, the data within the tables is safeguarded from such accidental or malicious deletions, maintaining its integrity and availability.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* google_bigquery_table
* *Arguments:* deletion_protection

To fix this issue, you need to enable deletion protection in your BigQuery tables. This can be done by setting the `deletion_protection` argument to `true` in the BigQuery table resource block in your Terraform code.

[source,go]
----
resource "google_bigquery_table" "example" {
  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.example.dataset_id
  table_id   = "example_table"

  deletion_protection = true
}
----

The above code is secure because it ensures that BigQuery tables have deletion protection enabled. This means that these tables cannot be deleted without first disabling the deletion protection, greatly reducing the risk of tables being accidentally deleted. This is a crucial safeguard to prevent the accidental loss of data.
