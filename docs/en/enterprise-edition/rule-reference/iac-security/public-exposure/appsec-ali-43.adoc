=== Impact
This policy ensures that MongoDB instances in Alibaba Cloud are not publicly accessible. Exposing MongoDB instances to the public internet can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Restricting access to specific IP addresses helps protect the database from unauthorized access and potential attacks.

Failing to restrict access to MongoDB instances can result in sensitive data being exposed to the public, with a higher risk of being compromised.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

* *Resource:* alicloud_mongodb_instance
* *Attribute:* security_ip_list

To mitigate this issue, ensure that the `security_ip_list` attribute in the `alicloud_mongodb_instance` resource does not include `0.0.0.0` or `0.0.0.0/0`.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_mongodb_instance" "example" {
  ...
-  security_ip_list = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
+  security_ip_list = ["192.168.1.1", "192.168.1.2"]
}
