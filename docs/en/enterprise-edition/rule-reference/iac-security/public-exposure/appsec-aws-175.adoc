=== Impact
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from attacks by allowing you to configure rules that allow, block, or monitor (count) web requests based on conditions that you define.
These conditions include IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, URI strings, SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_wafv2_web_acl
* *Attribute* rule - (Optional) The rule blocks used to identify the web requests that you want to allow, block, or count.
See Rules below for details.
