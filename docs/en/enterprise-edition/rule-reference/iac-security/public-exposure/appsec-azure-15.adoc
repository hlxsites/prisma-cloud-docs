=== Impact
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol secures transmission of data over the internet using standard encryption technology.
Encryption should be set with the latest version of TLS.
App service allows TLS 1.2 by default, which is the recommended TLS level by industry standards, for example, PCI DSS.
App service currently allows the web app to set TLS versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.
For secure web app connections it is highly recommended to only use the latest TLS 1.2 version.
