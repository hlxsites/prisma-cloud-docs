=== Description 


AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a service for migrating relational databases, data warehouses, NoSQL databases and other data stores.
DMS can be used to migrate data into the AWS Cloud, between on-premises instances, or between combinations of cloud and on-premises environments.
An AWS DMS replication instance can have one public IP address and one private IP address, just like an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that has a public IP address.
If you uncheck (disable) the box for Publicly accessible, then the replication instance has only a private IP address.
