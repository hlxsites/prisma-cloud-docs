=== Impact
This policy identifies the OCI Network Security Groups (NSG) security rules that have stateful ingress rules configured. It is recommended that Network Security Groups (NSG) security rules are configured with stateless ingress rules to slow the impact of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

To fix this issue, you should avoid setting the "stateless" attribute for ingress security rules to false.

[source,go]
----
resource "oci_core_network_security_group_security_rule" "example" {
  ...
  direction                 = "INGRESS"
-  stateless                 = false
+  stateless                 = true
}
----

The above code is secure because it sets the ingress security rule to stateless which is more secure.
