=== Description

This policy detects whether Azure Spring Cloud apps disable end-to-end TLS encryption. Disabling end-to-end TLS leaves your application traffic vulnerable, as data transmitted within your Azure Spring Cloud environment may be exposed to unauthorized access and interception. As a security best practice, it is strongly recommended to enable end-to-end TLS to protect your Spring Cloud application traffic. Enabling end-to-end TLS secures all traffic flowing between the ingress controller and your applications.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_spring_cloud_service, azurerm_spring_cloud_app
* *Arguments:* tls_enabled

To mitigate this issue, set the `tls_enabled` attribute to true within your Terraform configurations for Azure Spring Cloud applications.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "azurerm_spring_cloud_app" "example" {
  ...
+ tls_enabled         = true
}
----
