=== Impact
Enabling HTTPS for your Azure Spring Cloud API Portal can help improve the security of your API portal.
HTTPS is a secure protocol that encrypts data in transit, and using it can help prevent attackers from intercepting and reading your data.

=== How to Fix

*Terraform*

* *Resources:* azurerm_spring_cloud_api_portal
* *Attribute:* https_only_enabled


[source,go]

resource "azurerm_spring_cloud_api_portal" "pass" {
  name                          = "default"
  spring_cloud_service_id       = azurerm_spring_cloud_service.example.id
  gateway_ids                   = [azurerm_spring_cloud_gateway.example.id]
  https_only_enabled            = true
  public_network_access_enabled = true
