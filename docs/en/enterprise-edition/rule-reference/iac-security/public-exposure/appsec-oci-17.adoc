=== Impact
This policy identifies the OCI Virtual Cloud Networks (VCN) security lists that have stateful ingress rules configured in their security lists.
It is recommended that Virtual Cloud Networks (VCN) security lists are configured with stateless ingress rules to slow the impact of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* oci_core_security_list
* *Arguments:* vcn_id + ingress_security_rule


[source,go]
----
resource "oci_core_security_list" "pass" {
    compartment_id = oci_identity_compartment.tf-compartment.id
    vcn_id = oci_core_vcn.test_vcn.id
    ingress_security_rules {
        protocol = "all"
        source="192.168.1.0/24"
-        stateless = false
    }
}
