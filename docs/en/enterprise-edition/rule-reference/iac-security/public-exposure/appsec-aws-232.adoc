== AWS NACL allows ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 misconfiguration detected in code

=== Impact
Network Access Control List (NACL) is stateless and provides filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources.
We recommend that NACLs do not allow unrestricted ingress access to port 22.
Removing unfettered connectivity to remote console services, such as SSH, reduces a server's exposure to risk.

=== How to Fix


*CloudFormation* 




[source,yaml]
----
Resources:  
  InboundRule:
    Type: AWS::EC2::NetworkAclEntry
    Properties:
       NetworkAclId:
         Ref: MyNACL
       RuleNumber: 200
       Protocol: 6
       RuleAction: allow
-      CidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
+      CidrBlock: 10.0.0.0/32
       PortRange:
         From: 22
         To: 22
----


*Terraform* 




[source,go]
----
resource "aws_network_acl_rule" "example" {
  network_acl_id = aws_network_acl.example.id
  rule_number    = 200
  egress         = false
  protocol       = "tcp"
  rule_action    = "allow"
- cidr_block     = "0.0.0.0/0"
+ cidr_block     = "10.0.0.0/32"
  from_port      = 22
  to_port        = 22
}
