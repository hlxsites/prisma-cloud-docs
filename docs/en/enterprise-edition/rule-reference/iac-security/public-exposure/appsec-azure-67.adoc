=== Description 


This policy identifies Azure Function App which doesn't use HTTP 2.0.
HTTP 2.0 has additional performance improvements on the head-of-line blocking problem of the old HTTP version, header compression, and prioritization of requests.
HTTP 2.0 no longer supports HTTP 1.1's chunked transfer encoding mechanism, as it provides its own, more efficient, mechanisms for data streaming.
