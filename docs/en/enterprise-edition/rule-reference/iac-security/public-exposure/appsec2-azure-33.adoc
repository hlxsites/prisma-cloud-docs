=== Impact
This policy is designed to ensure that a storage account is properly configured with a private endpoint. The private endpoint facilitates a secure connection over a private network, rather than the public internet. 

If a storage account is not configured with a private endpoint, it poses a security risk as it might be accessible over the public internet. Unauthorized third parties could potentially gain access to the stored data, which may contain sensitive or proprietary information. Hence, it's crucial for the storage account to be properly configured with a private endpoint to maintain network security and data privacy.

=== How to Fix

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_storage_account, azurerm_private_endpoint

To fix this issue, configure your Azure storage account with a private endpoint.

[source,hcl]
----
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplestoracc"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"
  
  enable_https_traffic_only = true
}

resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "example" {
  name                 = "example_private_endpoint"
  location             = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  subnet_id            = azurerm_subnet.example.id
  
  private_service_connection {
    name                           = "example_psc"
    is_manual_connection           = false
    private_connection_resource_id = azurerm_storage_account.example.id
    subresource_names              = ["blob"]
  }  
}
----

In the above code, a private endpoint `example_private_endpoint` is configured for the storage account `examplestoracc`. The `private_service_connection` block connects the storage account to the private endpoint securely. The `subresource_names` item is set to `blob` to specify that the endpoint is for blob storage. Configuring a storage account with a private endpoint ensures that network traffic between the storage account and the endpoint remains within the Azure network, which significantly reduces the risk of data exfiltration.
