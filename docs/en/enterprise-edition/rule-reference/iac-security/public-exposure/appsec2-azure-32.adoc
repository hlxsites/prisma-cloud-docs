=== Impact
This rule is checking to ensure that a private endpoint is configured to a key vault in an Azure environment. Without a private endpoint configured, data stored in the key vault could be accessed, intercepted or altered by unauthorized individuals or systems, posing a significant security risk. A private endpoint provides a secure network path over Azureâ€™s private network, enhancing security by minimizing exposure to potential threats.

=== How to Fix

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_key_vault, azurerm_private_endpoint

Requires an Azure Key Vault to be connected to a private endpoint, you need to create both an azurerm_key_vault resource and an azurerm_private_endpoint resource and establish a connection between them in your Terraform configuration. Here is how to do it:

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {

  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  subnet_id           = azurerm_subnet.example.id

  private_service_connection {

    is_manual_connection           = false
    private_connection_resource_id = azurerm_key_vault.example.id
    subresource_names              = ["vault"]
  }
}
