=== Impact
Anonymous, public read access to a container and its blobs can be enabled in Azure Blob storage.
It grants read-only access to these resources without sharing the account key or requiring a shared access signature.
We recommend you do not provide anonymous access to blob containers until, and unless, it is strongly desired.
A shared access signature token should be used for providing controlled and timed access to blob containers.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* azurerm_storage_container
* *Arguments:* container_access_type


[source,go]

resource "azurerm_storage_container" "example" {
    ...
