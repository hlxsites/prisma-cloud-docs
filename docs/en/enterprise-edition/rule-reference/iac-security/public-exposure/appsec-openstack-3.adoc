=== Description 


In OpenStack, firewall rules are used to allow or deny traffic to or from a specific network or subnet.
When you create a firewall rule, you can specify the destination IP address or range that the rule applies to.
This allows you to control which traffic is allowed or denied based on the destination IP of the traffic.
