=== Impact
X-Ray tracing in lambda functions allows you to visualize and troubleshoot errors and performance bottlenecks, and investigate requests that resulted in an error.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


Add the following block to a Terraform Lambda resource to add X-Ray tracing:


[source,go]
----
tracing_config {
  mode = "Active"
}
----

*CloudFormation* 


For CloudFormation, use the following block under `Properties`:


[source,yaml]
----
"TracingConfig": {
  "Mode": "Active"
}
----
