=== Impact
Tiller (Helm v2) is the in-cluster component of Helm.
It interacts directly with the Kubernetes API server to install, upgrade, query, and remove Kubernetes resources.
It also stores the objects that represent releases.
Its permissive configuration could grant the users a broad range of permissions.
New versions of Kubernetes and Helm v3 have made Tiller obsolete, with its over permissive function in existing workloads remaining a security liability.
Consider upgrading to use Helm v3, which only runs on client machines.
Not all charts may support Helm 3, but the number that do is growing rapidly.


=== How to Fix


*Kubernetes* 


* *Resource:* Container
* *Arguments:*  labels:app / name - specifies the app label for the pod image - defines the image used by the container
