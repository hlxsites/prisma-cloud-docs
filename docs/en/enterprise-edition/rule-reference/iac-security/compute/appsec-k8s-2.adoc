=== Impact
Privileged containers are containers that have all of the root capabilities of a host machine, allowing  access to resources that are not accessible in ordinary containers.
Running a container with a privileged flag allows users to have critical access to the host's resources.
If a privileged container is compromised, it does not necessarily entail remote code execution, but it implies that an attacker will be able to run full host root with all of the available capabilities, including  CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
Common uses of privileged containers include: running a Docker daemon inside a Docker container, running a container with direct hardware access, and automating CI/CD tasks in the open-source automation server Jenkins.

=== How to Fix


*Kubernetes* 


* *Resource:* PodSecurityPolicy
* *Arguments:* privileged (Optional)  When set to false, containers are unable to run processes that are essentially equivalent to root on the host.


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: <policy name>
spec:
+ privileged: false
----


To use a **PodSecurityPolicy** resource, the requesting user or target pod's service account must be authorized to use the policy.
The preferred method is to grant access to the service account.

In the following example we use **RBAC**, a standard Kubernetes authorization mode.

A *Role* or *ClusterRole* must grant access to *use* the desired policies.

*Kind*: ClusterRole


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: <role name>
rules:
- apiGroups: ['policy']
  resources: ['podsecuritypolicies']
  verbs:     ['use']
  resourceNames:
  - <policy name>
----

The **ClusterRole** is then bound to the authorized service(s):

*Kind*: ClusterRoleBinding


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <binding name>
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: <role name>
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: <authorized service account name>
  namespace: <authorized pod namespace>
