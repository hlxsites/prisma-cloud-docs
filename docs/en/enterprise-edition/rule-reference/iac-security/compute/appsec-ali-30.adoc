=== Impact
Auto upgrades for minor versions help ensure that your RDS instance is running the latest version, which can include security updates and patches.
By enabling auto upgrades, you can help protect your RDS instance and the data it contains from vulnerabilities and threats.

=== How to Fix


* *Resource:* alicloud_db_instance
* *Arguments:* auto_upgrade_minor_version

To mitigate this issue, ensure the `auto_upgrade_minor_version` attribute is set to `Auto` in the `alicloud_db_instance` resource.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_db_instance" "example" {
  ...
+  auto_upgrade_minor_version  = "Auto"
}
----
