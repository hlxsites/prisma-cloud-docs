=== Impact
Using the Linux capabilities feature you can grant certain privileges to a process without granting all the privileges of the root user.
Added capabilities entitle containers in a pod with additional privileges that can be used to change core processes and networking settings of a cluster.
We recommend you only use privileges that are required for the proper function of the cluster.
To add or remove Linux capabilities for a container, you can include the capabilities field in the *securityContext* section of the container manifest.

=== How to Fix


*Kubernetes* 


* *Resource:* PodSecurityPolicy
* *Arguments:* allowedCapabilities (Optional)  

Provides a list of capabilities that may be added to a container beyond the default set.


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: <policy name>
spec:
- allowedCapabilities:
----


To use a *PodSecurityPolicy* resource, the requesting user or target podâ€™s service account must be authorized to use the policy. The preferred method is to grant access to the service account. In the following example we use *RBAC*, a standard Kubernetes authorization mode.

A *Role* or *ClusterRole* needs to grant access to use the desired policies.


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: <role name>
rules:
- apiGroups: ['policy']
  resources: ['podsecuritypolicies']
  verbs:     ['use']
  resourceNames:
  - <policy name>
----

The *ClusterRole* is then bound to the authorized service(s):

*Kind*: ClusterRoleBinding


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <binding name>
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: <role name>
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: <authorized service account name>
  namespace: <authorized pod namespace>
