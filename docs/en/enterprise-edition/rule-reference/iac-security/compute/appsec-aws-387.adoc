=== Impact
This policy identifies Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues that have an overly permissive access policy. It is highly recommended to have the least privileged access policy to protect the SQS queue from data leakage and unauthorized access.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

Ensure that the SQS queue policy does not allow public access by avoiding the use of wildcards (e.g., "*") in the policy without conditions.
