=== Impact
It is recommended to enable create_before_destroy argument inside the resource lifecycle configuration block to avoid a possible outage when the API Gateway needs to be recreated during an update.

=== How to Fix


*CloudFormation* 


CloudFormation creates a new API Gateway first and then will delete the old one automatically.


*Terraform* 




[source,go]
----
resource "aws_api_gateway_rest_api" "example" {
  name = "example"

+ lifecycle {
+   create_before_destroy = true
+ }
}
