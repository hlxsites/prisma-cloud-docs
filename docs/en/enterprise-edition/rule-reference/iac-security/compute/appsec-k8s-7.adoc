=== Description 


NET_RAW is a default permissive setting in Kubernetes allowing ICMP traffic between containers and  grants an application the ability to craft raw packets.
In the hands of an attacker NET_RAW can enable a wide variety of networking exploits from within the cluster.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Kubernetes* 


* *Resource:* PodSecurityPolicy
* *Arguments:* requiredDropCapabilities (Optional)  Defines the capabilities which must be dropped from containers.

These capabilities are removed from the default set, and must not be added.
NET_RAW capability is removed when the field includes it specifically, or when it includes *ALL*.


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: <policy name>
spec:
  requiredDropCapabilities:
+   -ALL
or
+ -NET_RAW
----


To use a *PodSecurityPolicy* resource, the requesting user or target podâ€™s service account must be authorized to use the policy. The preferred method is to grant access to the service account. In the following example we use *RBAC*, a standard Kubernetes authorization mode.

First, a *Role* or *ClusterRole* needs to grant access to use the desired policies.

*Kind*: ClusterRole


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: <role name>
rules:
- apiGroups: ['policy']
  resources: ['podsecuritypolicies']
  verbs:     ['use']
  resourceNames:
  - <policy name>
----

The *ClusterRole* is then bound to the authorized service(s):

*Kind*: ClusterRoleBinding

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <binding name>
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: <role name>
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: <authorized service account name>
  namespace: <authorized pod namespace>
