=== Description

Health checks ensure that a target is reachable before sending traffic from a load balancer to the endpoint.
This is a best practice compared to blindly sending traffic to what can be unhealthy targets.

////
=== Fix - Runtime
The way you enable health checks varies by the endpoint.
If you are using an autoscaling group:

. Go to the EC2 console and select Auto Scaling Groups

. Select the check box next to an existing group

. On the Details tab, choose Health checks and Edit

. Select your health check type

. Add a Health check grace period

. Select update
+
Or for the load balancer:

. Open the Amazon EC2 console

. Under Load Balancing, select Load Balancers

. Select your load balancer

. On the Health Check tab, choose Edit Health Check

. On the Configure Health Check page, configure your health check

. Select Save
////

* *Resource:* aws_lb_target_group, aws_alb_target_group
* *Arguments:* health_check

----
resource "aws_alb_target_group" "example" {
name = "target-group-1"
port = 80
protocol = "HTTP"


* has to be HTTP 200 or fails*
