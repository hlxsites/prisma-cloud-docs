=== Description 


The *Copy* instruction simply copies files from the local host machine to the container file system.
The *Add* instruction could potentially retrieve files from remote URLs and perform operations such as unpacking them.
The *Add* instruction, therefore, introduces security risks.
For example, malicious files may be directly accessed from URLs without scanning, or there may be vulnerabilities associated with decompressing them
We recommend you use the *Copy* instruction instead of the *Add* instruction in the Dockerfile.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Docker* 


[source,dockerfile]
