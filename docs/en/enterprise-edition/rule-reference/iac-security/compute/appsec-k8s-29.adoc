=== Impact
*securityContext* defines privilege and access control settings for your pod or container, and holds security configurations that will be applied to a container.
Some fields are present in both *securityContext* and *PodSecurityContext*,  when both are set, *securityContext* takes precedence.
Well-defined privilege and access control settings will enhance assurance that your pod is running with the properties it requires to function.

=== How to Fix


*Kubernetes* 


* *Resource:*  Container / Pod / Deployment / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / ReplicationController / Job / CronJob
* *Arguments:* securityContext (Optional)  A field that defines privilege and access control settings for your Pod or Container.
