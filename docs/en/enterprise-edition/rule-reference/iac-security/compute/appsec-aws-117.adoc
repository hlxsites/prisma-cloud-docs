=== Description 


By default, Lambda runs functions in a secure VPC with access to AWS services and the internet.
Lambda owns this VPC, which isn't connected to the account's default VPC.
Internet access from a private subnet requires Network Address Translation (NAT).
To give your function access to the internet, route outbound traffic to a NAT gateway in a public subnet.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_lambda_function
* *Arguments:* vpc_config.subnet_ids


For network connectivity to AWS resources in a VPC, specify a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC.
When you connect a function to a VPC, it can only access resources and the internet through that VPC.
`subnet_ids` - List of subnet IDs associated with the Lambda function.

NOTE: If both subnet_ids and security_group_ids are empty then vpc_config is considered to be empty or unset.


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_lambda_function" "test_lambda" {
  ...
  vpc_config {
    // Every subnet should be able to reach an EFS mount target in the same Availability Zone. 
    // Cross-AZ mounts are not permitted.
+   subnet_ids         = [aws_subnet.subnet_for_lambda.id]
    security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.sg_for_lambda.id]
  }
}

*CloudFormation*

To fix this issue, you should ensure that your AWS Lambda function configuration includes the `VpcConfig` property. Below is an example of how to set this property in a CloudFormation configuration:

Example:

[source,json]
