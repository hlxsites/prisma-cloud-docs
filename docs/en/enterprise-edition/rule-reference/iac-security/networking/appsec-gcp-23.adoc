=== Impact
In GKE, clusters can be set apart based on how they route traffic from one pod to another.
A cluster that uses alias IP ranges is called a VPC-native cluster.
A cluster that uses Google Cloud Routes is called a routes-based cluster.
We recommend you create Kubernetes clusters with alias IP ranges enabled.
Alias IP ranges allow Pods to directly access hosted services without using a NAT gateway.

=== How to Fix
