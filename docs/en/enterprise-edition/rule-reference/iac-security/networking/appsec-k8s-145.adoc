=== Description 


Allow Kubelet to manage iptables.
Kubelets can automatically manage the required changes to iptables based on how you choose your networking options for the pods.
It is recommended to let kubelets manage the changes to iptables.
This ensures that the iptables configuration remains in sync with pods networking configuration.
Manually configuring iptables with dynamic pod network configuration changes might hamper the communication between pods/containers and to the outside world.
You might have iptables rules too restrictive or too open.
