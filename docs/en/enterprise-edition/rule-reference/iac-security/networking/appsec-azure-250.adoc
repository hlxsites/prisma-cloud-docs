=== Impact
Azure Storage Sync Services with public network access are vulnerable to unauthorized access. Malicious actors could exploit this misconfiguration to gain entry and potentially compromise the entire network.

The Storage Sync Service manages registered servers and sync groups. Public network access exposes the service to brute-force attacks and other exploitation attempts from untrusted IPs. This bypasses network security controls, increasing the risk of data breaches and lateral movement within the environment.

Compromise could lead to data exfiltration, service disruption, and significant financial losses. Restricting network access to authorized entities only, using private endpoints, minimizes the attack surface and improves the overall security posture.

Implement private endpoints for Storage Sync Services. Restrict network access to only trusted IP addresses or virtual networks. Regularly review and update network configurations to maintain a strong security posture and prevent unauthorized access.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

Ensure that the `incoming_traffic_policy` for your Azure Storage Sync Service is configured with the least privilege network access and not set to `AllowAllTraffic`.

[source,go]
----
resource "azurerm_storage_sync" "example" {
  ...
-  incoming_traffic_policy = "AllowAllTraffic"
}
