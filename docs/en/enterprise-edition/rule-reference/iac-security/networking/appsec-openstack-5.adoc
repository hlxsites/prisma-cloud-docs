=== Impact
Explicitly setting a destination IP Address will make sure that the IP destination is managed in code.
You also need to ensure that the destination IP is not 0.0.0.0 so that the firewall rule is exposed to the world.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* openstack_fw_rule_v1
* *Arguments:* destination_ip_address

[source,go]
----
resource "openstack_fw_rule_v1" "fail" {
    name             = "my_rule_world"
    description      = "let anyone in"
    action           = "allow"
    protocol         = "tcp"
    destination_port = "22"
    enabled          = "true"
}
----



*CLI* 


----
openstack firewall group rule create --destination-ip-address 10.0.0.1
