=== Description 


The Transfer Acceleration feature in Object Storage Service (OSS) enables faster access and transfer of stored objects for global users by leveraging optimized network routes. However, it can result in higher data transfer costs compared to standard transfer rates. If cost control is a priority and accelerated transfer speeds are not required, consider disabling Transfer Acceleration to avoid additional expenses.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

* *Resource:* alicloud_oss_bucket
* *Arguments:* transfer_acceleration.enabled

To mitigate this issue, ensure the `transfer_acceleration.enabled` attribute is set to `true` in the `alicloud_oss_bucket` resource.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_oss_bucket" "example" {
  ...

  transfer_acceleration {
+    enabled = true
  }
}
----
