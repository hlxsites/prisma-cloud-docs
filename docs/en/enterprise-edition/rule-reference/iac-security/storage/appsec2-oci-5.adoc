=== Description

This policy is assessing whether the Kubernetes Engine Cluster boot volume is set up with in-transit data encryption. The reason why failing to implement this can be harmful is because unencrypted data can be easily intercepted during transit, potentially leading to a confidentiality breach. Enabling in-transit data encryption ensures that the data being transferred cannot be understood if intercepted, and hence, prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* oci_containerengine_node_pool
* *Arguments:* node_config_details.is_pv_encryption_in_transit_enabled

To fix the issue, you should enable in-transit data encryption for the boot volume of the Kubernetes Engine Cluster. You can do this by setting the "is_pv_encryption_in_transit_enabled" attribute to "TRUE" in your resource block.
