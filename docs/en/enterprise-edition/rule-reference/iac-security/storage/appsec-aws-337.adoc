=== Impact
This rule is verifying that AWS System Manager parameters are utilizing Key Management Service (KMS) customer-managed keys (CMK) for encryption. This rule is crucial for providing additional layers of security, as it ensures that all sensitive data processed and stored by System Manager parameters are protected by reliable encryption methods. Not complying with this rule means your SSM parameters are not fully protected, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_ssm_parameter
* *Arguments:* key_id

To fix the issue, you should enable encryption for SSM (System Manager) parameters using KMS Customer Master Key (CMK). CMK allows you to have more flexibility around key management, including who can use the key and for what resources.

[source,hcl]
----
resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "example" {
  name  = "example"
  type  = "SecureString"
  value = "example_value"
  key_id = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef"
}
----

In the above code, the `aws_ssm_parameter` resource is configured to use a key from KMS (Key Management Service). The `key_id` attribute specifies the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the KMS key that should be used for encrypting the value of the parameter.
