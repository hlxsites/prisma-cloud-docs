=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*

To fix this issue, ensure that the `kms_key_id` property in the `aws_cloudtrail` resource is set to a valid KMS key ID or ARN.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  ...
+  kms_key_id = "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/example-key-arn"
}
----


*CloudFormation* 

To fix this issue, ensure that the `KMSKeyId` property in the `AWS::CloudTrail::Trail` resource is set to a valid KMS key ID or ARN.

[source,yaml]
----
Resources:
    myTrail: 
    Type: AWS::CloudTrail::Trail
        Properties: 
            ...
+           KMSKeyId: alias/MyAliasName
