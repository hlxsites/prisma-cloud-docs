=== Description 

This policy ensures that Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is enabled on Alibaba Cloud RDS (Relational Database Service) instances. TDE helps protect data at rest by encrypting the storage of an entire database. It ensures that data is secured, meeting compliance requirements for protecting sensitive data.

Failing to enable Transparent Data Encryption can result in data breaches if unauthorized users gain access to the underlying storage of the database.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

* *Resource:* alicloud_db_instance
* *Attribute:* tde_status

To mitigate this issue, ensure that the `tde_status` attribute is set to `Enabled` for the `alicloud_db_instance` resource. Confirm that the `engine` is either `MySQL` or `SQLServer` and that the `engine_version` is supported.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_db_instance" "example" {
  ...

  engine          = "MySQL"
  engine_version  = "8.0"
+  tde_status      = "Enabled"
}
----
