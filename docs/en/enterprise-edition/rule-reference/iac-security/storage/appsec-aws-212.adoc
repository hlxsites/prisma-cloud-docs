=== Impact
This rule identifies Elastic File Systems (EFSs) which are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with Keys managed by Customer.
It is a best practice to use customer managed KMS Keys to encrypt your EFS data.
It gives you full control over the encrypted data.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resources:* aws_ebs_volume
* *Arguments:* kms_key_id


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_ebs_volume" "pass" {
  availability_zone = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[0]
  size              = 1
  encrypted         = true
  kms_key_id        = aws_kms_key.test.arn

  tags = {
    Name = "taggy"
  }
}
