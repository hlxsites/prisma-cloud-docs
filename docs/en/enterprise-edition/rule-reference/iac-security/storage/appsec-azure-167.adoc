=== Impact
Azure Container Registry retention policies help to manage image storage by automatically deleting untagged manifests. Enabling this policy ensures efficient usage of storage and removes potential vulnerabilities associated with stale or unused images.

This rule checks if the retention rule is enabled for Azure Container Registry, ensuring that untagged manifests are automatically deleted.

=== How to Fix

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_container_registry
* *Arguments:* retention_policy

[source,terraform]
----
resource "azurerm_container_registry" "example" {
  ...
  # If using azurerm version below 4.0
+ retention_policy {
+    enabled = true
+    days    = 7
+  }

  # If using azurerm version 4.0 and above
+ retention_policy_in_days = 7
}
