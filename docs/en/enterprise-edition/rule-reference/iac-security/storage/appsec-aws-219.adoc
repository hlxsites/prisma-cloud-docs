=== Impact
This policy identifies CodePipeline artifactStores which are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with Keys managed by Customer.
It is a best practice to use customer managed KMS Keys to encrypt your CodePipeline artifactStore  data.
It gives you full control over the encrypted data.

=== How to Fix


*Resource: aws_codepipeline* 




*Arguments: encryption_key* 




[source,text]
----
resource "aws_codepipeline" "pass" {
  name     = "tf-test-pipeline"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.codepipeline_role.arn

  artifact_store {
    location = aws_s3_bucket.codepipeline_bucket.bucket
    type     = "S3"

    encryption_key {
      id   = data.aws_kms_alias.s3kmskey.arn
      type = "KMS"
    }
  }
