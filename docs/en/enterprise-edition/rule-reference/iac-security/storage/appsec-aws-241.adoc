[cols="1,2"]

|Cortex AppSec Rule ID |APPSEC_AWS_241
|Category - Subcategory |Storage - Encryption
|Provider |AWS
|Severity |LOW
|Framework |Terraform
|Mapped CSPM/KSPM Rule |None
|===
 



=== Impact
This rule identifies Elastic File Systems (EFSs) which are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with Keys managed by Customer.
It is a best practice to use customer managed KMS Keys to encrypt your EFS data.
It gives you full control over the encrypted data.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_kinesis_firehose_delivery_stream
* *Arguments:* s3_configuration.server_side_encryption.key_arn


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_kinesis_firehose_delivery_stream" "pass" {
  name        = "terraform-kinesis-firehose-test-stream"
  destination = "s3"

  s3_configuration {
    role_arn   = aws_iam_role.firehose_role.arn
    bucket_arn = aws_s3_bucket.bucket.arn
  }

   server_side_encryption {
     enabled=true #default is false
     key_type = "CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK"
     key_arn = aws_kms_key.example.arn
   }
  tags = {
    test = "failed"
  }
}
