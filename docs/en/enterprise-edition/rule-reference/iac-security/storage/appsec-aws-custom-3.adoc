=== Description 


EBS snapshots must be encrypted, as they often include sensitive information, customer PII or CPNI.
Amazon EBS encryption uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMK) when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots.
With EBS encryption enabled, you no longer have to build, maintain, and secure your own key management infrastructure.

=== Fix - Runtime


* AWS Console* 


To change the policy using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

{
 "aws ec2 enable-ebs-encryption-by-default",
}

////

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_ebs_snapshot
* *Arguments:* encrypted - Whether the snapshot is encrypted.

Example fix:


[source,go]
----
{
 "resource "aws_ebs_snapshot" "example" {
  volume_id = "${aws_ebs_volume.example.id}"
+ encrypted = true
  ...
}
}
----
