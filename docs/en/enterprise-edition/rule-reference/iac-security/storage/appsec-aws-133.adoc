=== Impact
This check examines the attribute *backup_retention_period* this should have a value 1-35, and checks if its set to 0 which would disable the backup.
_This check is currently under review and maybe suppressed in future releases._

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_rds_cluster
* *Arguments:* backup_retention_period


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_rds_cluster" "test" {
  ...
+ backup_retention_period = 35
}
