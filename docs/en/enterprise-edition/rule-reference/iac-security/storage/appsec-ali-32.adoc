=== Impact
As a best practice, enable encryption for your Alibaba Cloud launch template data disks to enhance data security. This ensures that sensitive data at rest is protected from unauthorized access, all while requiring no changes to your business processes or applications.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*

* *Resource:* alicloud_ecs_launch_template
* *Arguments:* data_disks.encrypted

To mitigate this issue, ensure that the `encrypted` attribute for each data disk in the `data_disks` block is set to `true`.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_ecs_launch_template" "example" {
  ...

  data_disks = [
    {
      ...
+      encrypted = true
    }
  ]
}
----
