=== Description 


Deleting a key vault without soft delete enabled permanently deletes all secrets, keys, and certificates stored in the key vault.
Accidental deletion of a key vault can lead to permanent data loss.
Soft delete allows you to recover an accidentally deleted key vault for a configurable retention period.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* azurerm_key_vault
* *Arguments:* soft_delete_retention_days - (Optional) The number of days that items should be retained for once soft-deleted.

This value can be between 7 and 90 (the default) days.
