|Cortex AppSec Rule ID |APPSEC_AWS_199
|Category |Storage - Encryption
|Provider |AWS
|Severity |LOW
|Framework |Terraform
|Mapped CSPM/KSPM Rule |None

=== Impact
This rule identifies Elastic File Systems (EFSs) which are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with Keys managed by Customer.
It is a best practice to use customer managed KMS Keys to encrypt your EFS data.
It gives you full control over the encrypted data.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_imagebuilder_distribution_configuration
* *Arguments:* distribution.ami_distribution_configuration.kms_key_id


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_imagebuilder_distribution_configuration" "pass" {
  name        = "example"
  description = "non empty value"

  distribution {
    ami_distribution_configuration {
      kms_key_id = aws_kms_key.fail.arn
      ami_tags = {
        CostCenter = "IT"
      }

      name = "example-{{ imagebuilder:buildDate }}"

      launch_permission {
        user_ids = ["123456789012"]
      }
    }

    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
