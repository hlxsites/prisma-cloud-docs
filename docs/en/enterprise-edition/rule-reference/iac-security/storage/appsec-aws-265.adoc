=== Impact
This rule identifies Keyspace Tables which are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with Keys managed by Customer.
It is a best practice to use customer managed KMS Keys to encrypt your Keyspace Table data.
It gives you full control over the encrypted data.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_keyspaces_table
* *Arguments:* encryption_specification.kms_key_identifier


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_keyspaces_table" "pass" {
  keyspace_name = aws_keyspaces_keyspace.example.name
  table_name    = "my_table"

  schema_definition {
    column {
      name = "Message"
      type = "ASCII"
    }

    partition_key {
      name = "Message"
    }
  }
  encryption_specification {
    kms_key_identifier=aws_kms_key.example.arn
    type="CUSTOMER_MANAGED_KEY"
  }
