=== Impact
Ensure that your Microsoft Azure My SQL database servers have geo-redundant backups enabled, to allow you to restore your My SQL servers to a different Azure region in the event of a regional outage or a disaster.
Geo-restore is the default recovery option when your My SQL database server is unavailable because of a large-scale incident, such as a natural disaster, occurs in the region where the database server is hosted.

.During geo-restore, the My SQL server configuration can be changed.
These configuration changes include compute generation, vCore, backup retention period and backup redundancy options.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* azurerm_mysql_server
* *Arguments:* geo_redundant_backup_enabled


[source,go]
----
resource "azurerm_mysql_server" "example" {
  ...
+ geo_redundant_backup_enabled = true
}
