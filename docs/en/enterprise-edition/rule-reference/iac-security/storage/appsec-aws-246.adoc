=== Impact
This rule identifies RDS Cluster activity streams which are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with Keys managed by Customer.
It is a best practice to use customer managed KMS Keys to encrypt your RDS Cluster activity streams data.
It gives you full control over the encrypted data.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_rds_cluster_activity_stream
* *Arguments:* kms_key_id


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_rds_cluster_activity_stream" "pass" {
  resource_arn = aws_rds_cluster.default.arn
  mode         = "async"
  kms_key_id   = aws_kms_key.default.key_id

  depends_on = [aws_rds_cluster_instance.default]
}
