=== Description

Purge protection safeguards configuration stores from the irrecoverable, accidental purge of a deleted key. When enabled, a deleted key can't be permanently deleted until the protection is disabled. 

This policy ensures that Azure App Configuration has purge protection enabled to prevent accidental loss of important configuration keys.
