=== Description 


Ensure that your Microsoft Azure MariaDB database servers have geo-redundant backups enabled, to allow you to restore your MariaDB servers to a different Azure region in the event of a regional outage or a disaster.
Geo-restore is the default recovery option when your MariaDB database server is unavailable because of a large-scale incident, such as a natural disaster, occurs in the region where the database server is hosted.

.During geo-restore, the MariaDB server configuration can be changed.
These configuration changes include compute generation, vCore, backup retention period and backup redundancy options.

=== Fix - Runtime
* In Azure console* 


. Sign in to * Azure Management Console*.

. Navigate to * All resource**s blade at https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseAll to access all your Microsoft Azure resources.

. From the Type filter box, select Azure Database for MariaDB server to list the MariaDB servers provisioned within your Azure account.

. Click on the name of the MariaDB database server that you want to examine.

. In the navigation panel, under Settings, select Pricing tier to access the pricing tier settings available for the selected MariaDB server.

. On the Pricing tier page, in the Backup Redundancy Options section, check the backup redundancy tier configured for the database server.
+
If the selected tier is Locally Redundant, the data can be recovered from within the current region only, therefore the Geo-Redundant backup feature is not enabled for the selected Microsoft Azure MariaDB database server.

. Repeat steps no.
+
4 -- 6 for each MariaDB database server available in the current Azure subscription.

. Repeat steps no.
+
3 -- 7 for each subscription created in your Microsoft Azure cloud account.
