=== Description

This policy verifies that AWS CodeBuild S3 logs are encrypted. If not properly encrypted, these logs, which might contain sensitive information, can be exploited by attackers for malicious activities, posing a significant security risk.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_codebuild_project
* *Arguments:* logs_config.s3_logs.encryption_disabled

You need to ensure that the CodeBuild project is using an S3 bucket for logging that is configured with server-side encryption. In the below code sample, the `encryption_disabled` argument in the `s3_logs` block is set to `false`.

resource "aws_codebuild_project" "example" {

  artifacts {
