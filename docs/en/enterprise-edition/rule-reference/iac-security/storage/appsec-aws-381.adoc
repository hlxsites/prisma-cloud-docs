=== Description

This policy detects whether AWS CodeGuru Reviewer repository associations use Customer Managed Key (CMK) for encryption. CMKs empower users with granular control over key management, including policy setting, usage permissions, and detailed monitoring of access and key rotations. Default encryption options may not provide the level of security and compliance required for sensitive environments. Enforcing the use of CMKs for AWS CodeGuru Reviewer repository associations enables organizations to maintain strict access control and auditing, strengthening overall security posture.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_codegurureviewer_repository_association
* *Arguments:* kms_key_details

To mitigate this issue, ensure that the `encryption_option` parameter in the `kms_key_details` block is set to `CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK`. This ensures that a CMK is used for encryption.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_codegurureviewer_repository_association" "example" {
  ...
  kms_key_details {
+    encryption_option = "CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK"
  }
}
