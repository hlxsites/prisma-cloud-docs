=== Impact
This policy identifies  FSX openzfs file systems which are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with Keys managed by Customer.
It is a best practice to use customer managed KMS Keys to encrypt your  FSX openzfs file system data.
It gives you full control over the encrypted data.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_fsx_openzfs_file_system
* *Arguments:* kms_key_id


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_fsx_openzfs_file_system" "pass" {
  storage_capacity                = var.file_system.storage_capacity
  subnet_ids                      = var.subnet_ids
  deployment_type                 = var.file_system.deployment_type
  throughput_capacity             = var.file_system.throughput_capacity
  kms_key_id                      = var.kms_key_id
