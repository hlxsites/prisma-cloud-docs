With Allow Version Upgrade feature enabled, the Amazon Redshift engine upgrades (also known as major version upgrades) will occur automatically so the data warehouse service engine can get the newest features, bug fixes or the latest security patches released.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_redshift_cluster
* *Arguments:* allow_version_upgrade


[source,go]

resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "default" {
  ...
+ allow_version_upgrade = true
}
