This policy identifies AWS Redshift instances which are not encrypted. These instances should be encrypted for clusters to help protect data at rest which otherwise can result in a data breach.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*

In order to mitigate this issue, ensure `encrypted` is set to `true`.
