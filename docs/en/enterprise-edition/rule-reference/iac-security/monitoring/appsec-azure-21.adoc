=== Description 


The *alert notifications* setting within an Azure Security Center contact configuration specifies whether email notifications for high severity alerts are sent to the security contact. 
Enabling this setting ensures that the designated contacts are promptly informed of high severity security alerts, allowing for a quicker response to potential security incidents. 


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* azurerm_security_center_contact
* *Argument:* alert_notifications

It is a best practice to have *alert_notifications* set to *true* to enhance the overall security posture and incident response capabilities of your Azure environment.
