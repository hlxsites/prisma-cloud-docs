=== Impact
This rule ensures that enhanced monitoring is enabled for Amazon RDS instances. Enhanced monitoring provides detailed metrics in real-time for the operating system that your DB instance runs on, which helps in identifying and diagnosing performance issues. This rule checks whether the `MonitoringInterval` property is set to a valid value for enabling enhanced monitoring.

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_db_instance
* *Arguments:* monitoring_interval


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_db_instance" "default" {
  allocated_storage    = 10
  ...
+ monitoring_interval  = 5
  }
----


*CloudFormation*

To fix this issue, ensure that the `MonitoringInterval` property in the `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` resource is set to a valid value (1, 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 seconds).

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
Resources:
  MyRDSInstance:
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBInstance
    Properties:
      DBInstanceIdentifier: example-instance
+      MonitoringInterval: 60
      ...
----
