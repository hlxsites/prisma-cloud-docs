=== Description 


The kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to schedule restarts for containers.
Restarting a container in a deadlock state can help to make the application more available, despite bugs.
If a container is unresponsive, either to a deadlocked application or a multi-threading defect, restarting the container can make the application more available, despite the defect.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Kubernetes* 


* *Resource:* Container
* *Field:* livenessProbe (Optional)  The probe describes a health check to be performed against a container to determine whether it is alive or not.
Its arguments may include: exec, failureThreshold, httpGet, initialDelaySeconds, periodSeconds, successThreshold, tcpSocket and timeoutSeconds.
