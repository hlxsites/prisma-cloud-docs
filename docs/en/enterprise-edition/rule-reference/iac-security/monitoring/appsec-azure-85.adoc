=== Description 


Azure Defender is a cloud workload protection service that utilizes and agent-based deployment to analyze signals from Azure network fabric and the service control plane, to detect threats across all Azure resources.
It can also analyze non-Azure resources, utilizing Azure Arc, including those on-premises and in both AWS and GCP (once they've been onboarded).
Azure Defender for Kubernetes provides cluster-level threat protection by monitoring your AKS-managed services through the logs retrieved by Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
