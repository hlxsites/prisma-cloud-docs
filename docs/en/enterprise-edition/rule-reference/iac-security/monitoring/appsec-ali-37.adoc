=== Impact
This policy ensures that the `log_connections` parameter is enabled for Alibaba Cloud RDS instances. Enabling this parameter logs connection attempts to the database, providing valuable information for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing. These logs can help detect unauthorized access attempts, investigate connection issues, and ensure better database management.

Failing to enable this parameter reduces visibility into connection activity, which may hinder security monitoring and operational diagnostics.

=== How to Fix

* *Resource:* alicloud_rds_instance
* *Arguments:* log_connections

To mitigate this issue, ensure the `log_connections` parameter is set to `on` in the RDS instance configuration.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_rds_instance" "example" {
  ...
  parameter {
+    name  = "log_connections"
+    value = "on"
  }
}
----
