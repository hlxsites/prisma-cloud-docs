=== Impact
Enabling event notifications for your AWS CloudFormation stacks can help you to monitor and track changes to your stacks.
When event notifications are enabled, CloudFormation will send a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic each time a stack event occurs.
By doing so, you will improve your visibility and automation processes (if desired).

=== How to Fix


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_cloudformation_stack
* *Arguments:* notification_arns


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_cloudformation_stack" "default" {
    name = "networking-stack"
    ...
 +  notification_arns = ["arn1", "arn2"]
  }
