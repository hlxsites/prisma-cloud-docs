=== Description

This policy checks to ensure that Azure Defender for the cloud is enabled for the Resource Manager. Azure Defender is a key security feature that provides threat protection for workloads across Azure, on-premises, and other cloud environments. The Resource Manager, being a central management component, must have Azure Defender enabled to prevent the risk of unauthorized access and potential harm to resources. Failure to do so increases the risk of potential threats and cyber attacks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing
* *Arguments:* resource_type, tier


[source,go]
----
resource "azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing" "example" {
  tier          = "Standard"
  resource_type = "Arm"
  ...
}
----

This code enables Azure Defender for Cloud, which is a cloud native security service, for the Resource Manager. Once enabled, Azure Defender extends Azure Security Center's capabilities to include workloads hosted within Azure Resource Manager.
