* *Resource:* aws_sagemaker_data_quality_job_definition
* *Arguments:* network_config/enable_inter_container_traffic_encryption

Ensure that the `network_config`` block includes the `enable_inter_container_traffic_encryption`` argument, and set this argument to `true`, as displayed in the example below. 

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_sagemaker_data_quality_job_definition" "job_definition" {
  job_definition_name = "data-quality-job-definition"
  ...
  network_config {
+    enable_inter_container_traffic_encryption = true
  }
}
----

*CloudFormation*

* *Resource:* AWS::SageMaker::DataQualityJobDefinition
* *Arguments:* Properties/NetworkConfig/EnableInterContainerTrafficEncryption

Ensure that the `NetworkConfig` block includes the `EnableInterContainerTrafficEncryption` argument in your CloudFormation configuration file, and that this argument is set to `True`, as displayed in the example below.

[source,yaml]
