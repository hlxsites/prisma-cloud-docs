=== Description

This policy detects whether a Synapse SQL Pool has a security alert policy configured. A security alert policy is used to set up alerts for specific security incidents, abnormal activities, and threats in the SQL pool. This is crucial for real-time monitoring and maintaining the security posture of a Synapse workspace, helping to ensure the protection of your data.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_synapse_sql_pool
* *Arguments:* azurerm_synapse_sql_pool_security_alert_policy

Configure a security alert policy for your Synapse SQL Pool. Associate each `azurerm_synapse_sql_pool` resource with a `azurerm_synapse_sql_pool_security_alert_policy` block. This block defines the security alert policies for the pool.

In this example, a security alert policy for an Azure Synapse SQL Pool is configured using Terraform templates.

resource "azurerm_synapse_sql_pool" "example" {
