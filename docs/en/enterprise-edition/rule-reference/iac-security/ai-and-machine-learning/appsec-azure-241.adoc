=== Description

This policy detects whether Synapse SQL pools in Microsoft Azure are unencrypted. Encryption is vital for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and breaches. By enforcing encryption, this policy safeguards the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored within the SQL pools. Without encryption, data becomes vulnerable to cyberattacks, potentially leading to data leaks, financial losses, and reputational damage.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_synapse_sql_pool
* *Arguments:* data_encrypted

Enable encryption for your Azure Synapse SQL pool: Set the `data_encrypted` property to `true` within the corresponding `azurerm_synapse_sql_pool` resource definition.

To fix this issue, ensure that `data_encrypted` is set to `true` for your `azurerm_synapse_sql_pool` resource.
