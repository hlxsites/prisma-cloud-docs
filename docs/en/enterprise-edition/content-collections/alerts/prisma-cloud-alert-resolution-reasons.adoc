|REMEDIATED
|Alert was successfully remediated using the Cloud Service Provider’s CLI, either manually or auto-remediation.


|RESOURCE_ADDED
RESOURCE_UPDATED
RESOURCE_DELETED

|Resource was updated reason (based on the JSON metadata) indicates that a change was detected in one of the clauses included in a single or join policy statement within the policy RQL. With this resource update, the policy violation is no longer valid and the alert was resolved.


|RESOURCE_LIST_DISMISSED
RESOURCE_LIST_SNOOZED
|


|RESOURCE_POLICY_RESCOPED
|Alert was resolved because the policy was updated and the violating resource is no longer scanned or within the scope of the modified policy.


|SCHEDULED

|As a result of some Prisma Cloud scanning engine optimizations, some of the *Open* and *Resolved* alerts were updated with the reason *Scheduled*. This was done inadvertently, is not related to a change in the cloud resource that triggered the alert, and will be addressed with a fix in an upcoming release. For IAM alerts, *Scheduled* is the the only supported reason.
