== Saved Views

Create *Saved Views* to prioritize and organize your alerts into appropriate threat vector categories. Prisma Cloud provides a set of default views â€” Overview, Misconfigurations, Incidents, Malware, and Highest Priority.

Out of the box views such as *High-Priority*, *Attack Paths*, and *Incidents* etc, include preset filters that display the most relevant alerts for each category.  


[NOTE]
====
Default (*System*) views are initially the opinionated suggestion of what a view should be based upon the problem being solved. If you make changes to a Default view, the changes are persisted each time you return to that view. Default views do not reset to the initial System view and cannot be deleted or reordered. *Overview*, which is the first view, also cannot be hidden.
