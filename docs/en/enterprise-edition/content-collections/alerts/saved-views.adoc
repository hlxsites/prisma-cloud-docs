== Saved Views

Create *Saved Views* to prioritize and organize your alerts into appropriate threat vector categories. Prisma Cloud provides a set of default views — Overview, Misconfigurations, Incidents, Malware, and Highest Priority.

[NOTE]
====
Default (*System*) views are initially the opinionated suggestion of what a view should be based upon the problem being solved. If you make changes to a Default view, the changes are persisted each time you return to that view. Default views do not reset to the initial System view.
