== Identity Dashboard

Prisma Cloud's *Identity* dashboard provides a comphrehensive view of your security risk across the entire identity landscape – users, permissions, access levels, and more. The dashboard provides critical insights into user activity, permissions, and potential risks, to help you proactively detect and mitigate identity-based threats like unauthorized access, attack paths, and privilege escalations. 

Use the Identity dashboard as a tool for risk oversight across all the supported cloud platforms and quickly evaluate your identity posture using real-time data. Use the provided *Filters* to hone in on the time period, cloud account, or account group you would like to focus on. By default, the dashboard shows your identity risk status for the last 24 hour period. The Identity dashboard is available to users with the System Administrator role across all stacks, with the exception of http://app.gov[app.gov] and http://app.cn[app.cn.]

NOTE: Asset totals reported on the Identity Dashboard and Asset Inventory are the sum of all assets with violations and not the total number of alerts generated by that asset. The Assets page therefore may have a different total than the tally found on the Identity dashboard and should not be compared.

=== Identity Inventory Summary and Risks

The intent behind this is to show what the customers have to give the user perspective on their “Identity and Access Management” estate and show the associated security risks with each type of identity.

Includes:

# of Users 

# of Machine Identities (such as EC2 instance, Lambda, Azure and GCP Functions, VMs)

# of Cloud Service Accounts (such as AWS Roles, Azure Service Principals and Managed Identities, and GCP Service Accounts)

IAM Policies (such as AWS IAM Policy, Azure, and GCP Roles)

IAM Groups

 Misconfigurations

The intent behind this is to show if there are identities with common misconfigurations that hackers can use for easy access to the customer cloud.

Start with showing a minimum of the last 30 days.

 Over - Permissive Risks

The intent behind this is to show if there are identities that have overly permissive access, such as:

The “Inactive Users” section shows the total number of inactive users for 30 days and more per cloud provider. 

The “Identities with Unused Permissions” section shows identities (users/machines/groups/cloud service accounts) with unused permissions for more than 90 days.

The “Identities with Excessive Policies” section shows identities (users/machines/groups/cloud service accounts) with excessive policies attached. The IAM policy (AWS policy or Azure/GCP role) will be considered excessive:

 When the action or/and scope of this policy includes “*” in any way for AWS

Action  includes *, and the level of role assignment is Subscription or higher for Azure 

Basic and Service Agent roles are granted at Folder or higher level for GCP

Such permissions are extremely dangerous and difficult to monitor.

Start with showing a minimum of the last 90 days.

 Admin Summary and Risks

In this widget, you can find information about your Admin Identities. We identify identity as admin if it meets the following criteria:

Has one of the Built-in Admin policies

Has custom policies with administrative permissions

In addition to the access, we take into consideration the level on which this access was granted for the identity
