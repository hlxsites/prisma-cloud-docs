== Unified Vulnerability Management

With Code-to-cloud Unified Vulnerability Management, you get complete visibility of all the vulnerable assets across your entire application lifecycle, prioritize and identify the risky and critical ones to focus on, assess the risks, and take actions to remediate or mitigate vulnerabilities in Code or in Cloud.

image::dashboards/vuln-dashboard.png[]

Meet the following prerequisites for Prisma Cloud to populate the vulnerability management data in the dashboard:

**Prerequisites**

* xref:../connect/connect-cloud-accounts/connect-cloud-accounts.adoc[Onboard Cloud accounts] in the Platform.
* xref:../application-security/get-started/connect-code-and-build-providers/code-repositories/code-repositories.adoc[Onboard code repositories] in Application Security.
* Onboard registries <link> and workloads for vulnerability scanning.
* xref:../runtime-security/vulnerability-management/registry-scanning/configure-registry-scan.adoc[Configure registry scans].
* Enable xref:../governance/governance.adoc[Prisma Cloud policy] in platform.

This section helps you to:

* Get an overview of the vulnerabilities trend across your workload.
** Get a report of all your compute assets' vulnerabilities.
** View the trend of vulnerabilities fixed and closed over a defined period of time (say, month, and year).
* Trace vulnerabilities in runtime to the code that introduced it.
* Narrow down your search to identify what are the important/critical vulnerabilities.
* View the vulnerabilities that are patchable and have a fix action item to remediate.
* Identify what assets are affected by a known vulnerability and where the vulnerable assets are used in your application lifecycle.
** Assess if your container images have vulnerabilities using a CI scan (Jenkins, Shell).
** Check if any of your container registries, Host VM images, deployed containers, or Serverless functions have vulnerabilities.

* Access the impact of the vulnerability on the assets (Risk assessment).
** Pick the most impacted vulnerability with the highest CVE score and explore remediation options.
** Identify if one of the compute assets is vulnerable to CVE-XXXX-XXXX.
** Or find vulnerabilities equal to CVE-XXXX-XXXX.
* Review the CVE (or assets) for threat details and explore the remediation options.
** Remediate the vulnerabilities at runtime and create a PR to fix the vulnerability at the source.
** What vulnerabilities to fix and how to fix for container images or hosts?

=== Discover Vulnerabilities

In *Dashboard > Vulnerabilities* you can discover all the vulnerabilities across your environment.
As an example, there are 1.4K vulnerabilities in your environment out of which only 16997 are critical and high, 2697 are exploitable, out of which 2636 are patchable meaning these vulnerabilities are actionable for you to fix them. The funnel in the Prioritized Vulnerabilities further narrows down to just 5 vulnerable packages that are in use in the runtime that you can focus on.

==== Vulnerabilities Overview

Visualize the trends with *Total Vulnerable Assets*, and their metadata, *Total Vulnerabilities Remediated*, and *Total Vulnerabilities* count in the current snapshot.

==== Prioritized Vulnerabilities

The vulnerabilities sourced from Compute and CAS (Cloud App Sec) are prioritized and aggregated based on the most urgent, exploitable, patchable, and vulnerable packages in use. This prioritization helps you to identify the top-priority vulnerabilities to focus on.
//The vulnerabilities data sources are:
//Current Ph1:
//- Compute
//- CAS (Cloud App Sec)
//Ph2: (Third parties)
//- Qualys
//- Tenable
//- AWS Inspector

The aggregation is based on vulnerabilities that are:
- Urgent: Critical, High
- Exploitable: Exploit in the Wild and Exploit in POC
- Patachable: Vulnerabilities that are actionable and have a patch to fix or mitigate.
- Vulnerable packages in use

==== Top Impacting Vulnerabilities

Review the top-impacting vulnerabilities based on the CVE severity, CVSS score, Risk Factors, and the assets impacted across your CI/CD pipeline.

==== Vulnerability Impact by Stage

Visualize the sources of the vulnerabilities and the impact of the vulnerability across app stages of your application lifecycle.

At each stage, you can select and investigate any of the impacted assets such as Packages, Images in IaC Files, Host VM Images, Registry Images, Deployed Images, Serverless Functions, and Hosts.
This makes it easier for you to trace back the packages and images that were used to build a workload that is now vulnerable in deploy stage, or in runtime.

=== Prioritize and Assess Risk

Once you get a summarized view of all the discovered vulnerabilities, the dashboard helps you to narrow down to the most important and/or critical vulnerabilities to focus on.

Following are the paths you take to investigate and assess risk across the CBDR graph:

[cols="30%a,30%a,40%a"]
|===

|*What do you want to do*
|*Where to go*
|*Result*

|View the top critical and high vulnerabilities
|In *Prioritized Vulnerabilities* select *Critical and High*
|Vulnerabilities with *Critical* and *High* *Severity* are listed under *Investigate*.

|View top exploitable vulnerabilities
|In *Prioritized Vulnerabilities* select *Exploitable*
|Vulnerabilities that are high and critical with *Risk factors* *Exploitable* are listed under *Investigate*.

|View top patchable vulnerabilities
|In *Prioritized Vulnerabilities* select *Patchable*
|Vulnerabilities that are high and critical with *Risk factors* *Has fix* are listed under *Investigate*.

|View vulnerabilities in use
|In *Prioritized Vulnerabilities* select *In Use*
|Vulnerabilities that are high and critical with *Risk factors* *Package in use* are listed under *Investigate*.
Prisma Cloud provides real-time runtime protection with its Defender. With Defender's scanning, you can know, for example, which of the application packages are actually being used. 
The Packages in Use are indicated across your workflow in a CBDR graph/tabular view under *Investigate > Search*.

NOTE: You need to deploy agents to get real-time OS data to determine if the vulnerability is in use by any of the packages.

|Identify the assets vulnerable to a CVE
|In *Top Impacting Vulnerabilities* select a `CVE-XXXX-XXXXX`
|Assets affected by the vulnerability with cve.id=`CVE-XXXX-XXXXX` are listed in a CBDR graph under *Investigate*.

|View vulnerable serverless functions on Runtime
|In *Vulnerability Impact By Stage* select *Serverless Functions*
|Serverless functions with high vulnerability are listed under *Investigate*

|See vulnerable deployed container images in Runtime
|In *Vulnerability Impact By Stage* select *Deployed images*
|Container images with high vulnerability are listed under *Investigate*.

|Show vulnerable hosts in Runtime
|In *Vulnerability Impact By Stage* select *Hosts*
|Hosts with high vulnerability are listed under *Investigate*.

|See vulnerable registry images in Deploy
|In *Vulnerability Impact By Stage* select *Registry Images*
|Container Registry images with high vulnerabilities are listed under *Investigate*

|View host VM images with high vulnerability
|In *Vulnerability Impact By Stage* select *Host VM Images*
|Host VMs with high vulnerability are listed under *Investigate*.

You can expand the assets in each CBDR stage and view details.

=== Remediate or Mitigate Vulnerabilities

//What can I do to fix the vulnerabilities in the code or fix them at runtime?
As you access the vulnerability Overview, Top Impacting Vulnerabilities, and Vulnerability Impact by Stage, you can now explore the remediation options.
Following are the remediation actions you can take for different asset types:
- Submit Pull Request for CVEs and packages
- Suppress for packages
- Create Jira ticket for hosts, registry images, and deployed images
- For Serverless functions, you can view the vulnerabilities details config file.

[#remediate-cve]
==== Remediate or Mitigate a CVE

In the CBDR graph, click on a vulnerable *CVE > View Details*.
The side panel gives you an overview of the CVE with it's CVSS score, the impacted stages, severity, the risk factors, and the package name and the distros affected by this CVE.

Let's say, you want to investigate a specific CVE that is critical, exploitable, has a patch, and is affecting the runtime instances.

image::vuln-dashboard-top-impacting-vuln.gif[]

* Select *Remediate > Submit Pull Request* for all packages and IaC files affected by this vulnerability across all repositories.
//We need to call out expected behaviors (what happens when an user submits a PR for a group of packages or if no repository is onboarded?) from an UX/UI perspective.
* *Send To > Jira* to create a Jira ticket with all the vulnerability details of the deployed images, registry images, and hosts.
** *Select Template** from the available ones, or add a new integration template <link>.
** Enter an *Assignee* for the Jira ticket.
** Select *Send*.

* The *Assets* in the CVE sidepanel, lists all the asset types affected by this CVE from the packages and IaC files in code & build to the images in the registry that are being deployed to the runtime as Hosts, Containers, and Serverless functions.
** You can filter the assets based on *Risk Factors*, download all assets configurations, or take mitigation actions per asset type (see xref:#remediate-asset).

//<add-note-for-RLP-110563?focusedCommentId=784561>
Note: *Dashboard > Vulnerabilities* shows a total count of all the vulnerabilities across all the distro releases in your workload, which is higher than the total count of only the CVEs affecting your assets shown under *Investigate > Search*.
For example, when multiple vulnerabilities are attached to a single CVE, the vulnerability search shows a total count of only the CVEs impacted by these vulnerabilities.

[#remediate-asset]
==== Remediate or Mitigate an Asset

In the CBDR graph, expand all the assets and select an asset in any of the application stages.
In assets' side panel review the assets for threat details, alerts, vulnerabilities, process info, package info, labels, and view assets' configuration.

<gif>

To remediate an asset, select a CVE and then select *Assets*.
For example, with attack path analysis, you can assess a weak host that is internet exposed, has vulnerabilities and has access to PII (credit card). See the policies violated that generated these findings and
