== Vulnerabilities Dashboard

Prisma Cloud *Vulnerabilities Dashboard* provides a robust vulnerability management system, that seamlessly detects vulnerabilities across your entire workload, from Code to Cloud.
The Vulnerability dashboard gives you a holistic graphical view of all the vulnerabilities and narrows them down to the most critical and urgent ones, and the ones that are actionable. You get an overview of the top impacting vulnerabilities based on the CVEs, and the vulnerabilities impact by your app lifecycle in a CBDR view.

You can further investigate the findings on the dashboard to assess the root cause of the vulnerability, trace it back to the source, and suggest the steps you can take to remediate the vulnerabilities. This risk assessment helps you make informed decisions and take action to remediate the vulnerabilities and secure your environment.

The following four visualizations are available to help you contextualize risk:

* Vulnerabilities Overview
* Prioritized Vulnerabilities
* Top Impacting Vulnerabilities
* Vulnerability Impact by Stage

|*Vulnerabilities Overview*
|Provides a summarized view of the total vulnerabilities in your environment further divided into Vulnerabilities by Asset and Vulnerabilities that have already been remediated, allowing you to track and share your progress in securing your environment.

|*Prioritized Vulnerabilities*
|Discover all the vulnerabilities across your workloads and identify the top-priority vulnerabilities (aggregated vulnerabilities that are urgent, exploitable, patchable, and the vulnerable packages in use).

|*Top Impacting Vulnerabilities*
|Provides a ranked list of the most critical vulnerabilities in your environment based on the risk score. The ranked list consists of CVEs that are affecting the environment. Each CVE includes data about its risk factors, severity, CVSS, risk factors, and assets impacted.

|*Vulnerability Impact by Stage*
|Identify the top impactful vulnerabilities across the entire SDLC.
