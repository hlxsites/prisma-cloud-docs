== Get Started with Dashboards

Prisma Cloud® dashboards help you gain visibility into the health and security posture of your cloud infrastructure. Share customized dashboards with your team to keep them in sync with your progress in securing your cloud infrastructure. Dashboards, available out of the box, provide a prioritized and graphical view of your cloud accounts and assets. Use the predefined or custom time range to view current trends or reconfigure to view historical data.

====
Custom Dashboards offer default filter capabilities and allow you to customize any combination of dashboard widgets. However, filters cannot be applied to Vulnerabilities, Code Security, and Code to Cloud widgets, with the exception of the Command Center dashboard which supports filtering for Urgent Vulnerabilities, Top Vulnerable Images and Top Vulnerable Hosts widgets.
