Prisma Cloud® dashboards help you gain visibility into the health and security posture of your cloud infrastructure. Share customized dashboards with your team to keep them in sync with your progress in securing your cloud infrastructure. Dashboards, available out of the box, provide a prioritized and graphical view of your cloud accounts and assets. Use the predefined or custom time range to view current trends or reconfigure to view historical data.
