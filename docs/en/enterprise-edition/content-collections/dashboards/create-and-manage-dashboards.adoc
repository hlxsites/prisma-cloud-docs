== Create and Manage Dashboards

Track, visualize, and share the metrics that matter most to you and your team with Prisma Cloud custom dashboards. Widgets with visual representations in various formats such as line and bar graphs and pie charts are available to track key metrics such as assets with the most urgent alerts and vulnerabilities, resource compliance trend charts, and top risks to remediate. Share dashboard visualizations with your management team to quantify your progress in hardening your security posture.

[.procedure]
. Select the *Toggle Table* icon to convert the data visualization in a widget to a table. You can also choose the *Full Screen* button to expand widget dimensions to the maximum size. 

. You can edit the views in any widget once you have added them to your custom dashboard. Follow these steps to edit a widget:

.. Select the *Edit* button from the Widget menu. The editable options vary from widget to widget and may include chart name, chart variable such as number of vulnerabilities listed, data source for compliance trends over time and more.

.. Select the *Clone* button to duplicate the widget. 

.. Select the *Delete* button to delete any widget from a dashboard. 

The table below provides an overview of all the available widgets and describes their functionality:

=== Manage Dashboards

Follow the steps below to manage the dashboards you've created.

[.procedure]
. Select *Manage Dashboards* to clone or delete any existing dashboard.
.. Select the dashboard you want to delete from the drop-down list and select *Clone* or *Delete*.
.. Select the action button on any dashboard to easily copy or delete the selected dashboard.

=== Share Dashboards

Share the custom dashboards you have created with members of your organization or tenant to further collaboration and communication. Once you've configured the dashboard access levels, sharing is as simple as providing the URL to your team. The steps below capture the workflow:

[.procedure]
. Select *Dashboards* from the Prisma Cloud administrative console. Make a note of the Prisma Cloud switcher mode you are on. For instance, Cloud, Runtime or Application Security. Custom dashboards created in a specific mode are only viewable in that mode.

. *Share Dashboards: Update Access Setting*

.. Select the *Menu* dropdown from the *Dashboards* navigation menu. 
.. Click the actions menu to the left of your custom dashboard and select *Share*.
.. Select *Public* from the *Access Settings* drop-down and click *Update*.
.. Share the URL of your dashboard with anyone in your organization to provide access.

. Optionally, follow the steps below to help your users discover the Dashboard you've created:

.. We recommend that you guide users to toggle on the the *Visibility* setting of the shared Dashboard under *Dashboards> Menu > Manage Dashboards*. 
.. Once the dashboard is shared globally, it will appear by default at the bottom of the *Manage Dashboards* list and can be reordered to the top by individual users for easy access. If the user you wish to share a dashboard with, is currently on the Dashboards page, they will also need to refresh the page to see the shared dashboard. 

[NOTE] 
====
Keep the following caveats in mind when sharing dashboards: +

* If you received a shared dashboard URL and haven’t updated the dashboard’s *Visibility* settings, the shared dashboard will only show up temporarily on the Menu tab. To ensure it’s always accessible from the Menu tab follow the steps listed above. +

* Users accessing a shared dashboard may see a `permission denied` error message if they do not have the appropriate access levels for individual widgets within the dashboard.
