== Compliance Dashboard

Prisma Cloud's *Compliance* dashboard provides a snapshot view of your overall compliance posture across multiple compliance standards. The dashboard provides you with an interactive look at how your compliance coverage maps to the established compliance frameworks available within Prisma Cloud.

Use the Compliance dashboard as a tool for risk oversight across all the supported cloud platforms and quickly evaluate your compliance posture using real-time data. Use the provided *Filters* to hone in on the time period, cloud account, or account group you would like to focus on. By default, the dashboard shows your compliance state for the last 24 hour period. The Compliance dashboard is available to users with the System Administrator role on all stacks, with the exception of http://app.gov[app.gov] and http://app.cn[app.cn.]

NOTE: Asset totals reported on the Compliance Dashboard and Asset Inventory are the sum of all assets with violations and not the total number of alerts generated by that asset. The Assets page therefore may have a different total than the tally found on the Compliance dashboard and should not be compared. 

=== Compliance Overview

The compliance score presents data on the total unique resources that are passing or failing the policy checks that match compliance standards. Use this score to audit how many unique resources are failing compliance checks and get a quick count on the severity of these failures. The links allow you to view the list of all resources on the *Inventory* page, and the *View Alerts* link enables you to view all the open alerts of Low, Medium, or High severity.

=== Compliance Trend

The compliance trendline is a line chart that shows you how the compliance posture of your monitored resources have changed over time (on the horizontal X axis). You can view the total number of resources monitored (in blue), and the number of resources that passed (in green) and failed (in red) over that time period.

=== Compliance Coverage

The Compliance coverage bar graph highlights the passed and failed resource count across all compliance standards for easy comparison. Selct any given compliance standard to view the total number of failed assets for that standard. Click on the compliance standard to view policy details.
