== Text to RQL Examples

With Prisma Cloud Copilot, you can type your questions that are automatically converted to an RQL query and the query is then executed.

=== Asset RQL Examples

The following table lists the text (prompts) related to assets that you can enter and the Copilot will generate the corresponding RQL query:
