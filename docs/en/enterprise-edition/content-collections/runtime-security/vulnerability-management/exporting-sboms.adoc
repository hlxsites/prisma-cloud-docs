== Exporting Software Bill of Materials on CycloneDX

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a detailed inventory of all software components, dependencies, and associated metadata within an application. The purpose of an SBOM is to provide clear visibility into these components, ensuring they meet security and compliance standards.

SBOMs can deliver the transparency that software users now demand by enabling a standard approach to understanding what is in an application and why.

Prisma Cloud supports exporting SBOM files in the CycloneDX v1.4 standard (https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.4/json/[JSON] or https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.4/xml/[XML]) for function, image, and host scans.

=== Download format for SBOMs

SBOM files can be downloaded either through API calls or twistcli.

==== Download SBOMs using twistcli tool

You can export SBOMs using the following option in `twistcli images scan` tool:

`--SBOM [file_format]`

The file format values are `cyclonedx_json` or `cyclonedx_xml`.

The SBOM output is concatenated with the scan results output. Use the `--output` flag to print the scan results and SBOM output to a specified file.
