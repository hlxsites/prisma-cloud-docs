*Prerequisites:*

* xref:../../install/deploy-defender/defender-types.adoc#[Install a Defender] somewhere in your environment.

* GCR access is governed by Google's storage permissions.
For Prisma Cloud to scan GCR, your service account must have the GCP IAM *Storage Object Viewer* role (see https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control#permissions_and_roles[Permissions and roles]).

* Grant Prisma Cloud access to your registry with a https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication[service account JSON key file].
Your JSON token blob will look something like this:

[source,yaml]

[.procedure]
. Open Console, then go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Registry settings*.

. Select *Add registry*.

. In *Version*, select *Google Container Registry*.

. Enter the registry address in the *Registry* field (e.g. `gcr.io`).

. Enter the repository name followed by `/{asterisk}` in the *Repository* field (e.g. `company-sandbox/*`).

. In *Credential*, enter the credentials required to access the registry. Select a credential from the list from the onboarded Google Cloud accounts. If the required credential isn't available, click *Add new credential* to onboard the needed account.

NOTE: For GCP organizations with hundreds of projects, scanning GCR using organization level credentials might affect the scanning performance due to long query time from GCP. Therefore, the best approach to reduce scan time and to avoid potential timeouts, is to divide the projects within your organization into multiple GCP folders. Then, create a service account and credential for each one of them, and use these credentials for GCR scanning.

. In *OS type*, specify whether the repo holds *Linux x86_64*, *Linux ARM64*, or *Windows* images.

. In *Scanners scope*, specify the collections of defenders to use for the scan.
+
Console selects the available Defenders from the scope to execute the scan job according to the *Number of scanners* setting.
For more information, see xref:../../vulnerability-management/registry-scanning/configure-registry-scanning.adoc#deployment-patterns[deployment patterns].

. In *Number of scanners*, enter the number of Defenders across which scan jobs can be distributed.

. Set *Cap* to the number of most recent images to scan.
+
Leaving *Cap* set to *5* will scan the 5 most recent images.
Setting this field to *0* will scan all images.

.. Optionally, add a *Version matching pattern*.

. Select *Add*.

. Click *Add and scan*.
+
Verify that the images in the repository are being scanned under *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Images > Registry settings*.
