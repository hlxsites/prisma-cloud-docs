=== Agentless Scanning for Cloud Accounts

* *During Onboarding*: When cloud accounts are onboarded to Prisma Cloud with the "Agentless Scanning" option enabled, scanning starts immediately. This provides instant visibility into the vulnerabilities and configurations risks for the account. If this option is disabled before onboarding, Prisma Cloud does not scan the workloads in the account. The account remains unscanned until agentless scanning is enabled.

+ 
To modify the scan settings, see <<enable-agentless-scan>>.


* *For existing accounts*: Enabling agentless scanning for existing accounts in Prisma Cloud does not initiate an immediate scan. Instead, these accounts are added to the next scheduled scan cycle, which occurs every 24 hours by default. This ensures that scans are conducted systematically according to the scan cycle, rather than starting immediately upon enabling.

+ 
To modify the scan cycle, see <<modifying-the-agentless-scan-interval>>.
