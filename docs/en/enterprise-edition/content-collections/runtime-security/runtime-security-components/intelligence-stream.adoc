== Intelligence Stream

The Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream is a real-time feed that contains vulnerability data and threat intelligence from a variety of certified upstream sources. Prisma Cloud continuously pulls data from known vulnerability databases, official vendor feeds and commercial providers to provide the most accurate vulnerability detection results. 

In addition to the information collected from official feeds, Prisma Cloud feeds are enriched with vulnerability data curated by a dedicated research team. Our security researchers monitor cloud and open source projects to identify security issues through automated and manual means. As a result, Prisma Cloud can detect new vulnerabilities that were only recently disclosed, and even vulnerabilities that were quietly patched.

The Prisma Cloud console automatically connects to the intelligence server and downloads updates without requiring any special configuration. The Intelligence Stream is updated several times per day, with consoles continuously checking for updates.

=== Impact of Intelligence Stream updates on customers

* Any changes to the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream impact all customers, regardless of their console version.
* However, some updates might require both the console and Defenders to be upgraded to fully support the changes. These requirements will be communicated through the Release Notes.
