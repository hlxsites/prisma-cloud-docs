== Prisma Cloud Application Security

The Application Security on Prisma Cloud console provides comprehensive security for your software engineering environment, covering the entire software development lifecycle from code to cloud.

=== Scanning Capabilities

The Application Security comprehensive scanning capabilities include: 

* *Infrastructure as Code (IaC)*: Identifies misconfigurations and vulnerabilities within your IaC templates (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) to ensure secure cloud infrastructure provisioning

* *Software Composition Analysis (SCA)*: Scans for known vulnerabilities in your application dependencies (direct and indirect packages) to mitigate potential security risks from third-party components

* *License* noncompliance: Scans for software license noncompliance

* *Secrets Security*: Detects exposed secrets like passwords, API keys, and tokens within your code to prevent unauthorized access and breaches

* *CI/CD Pipeline Security*: Analyzes your CI/CD pipelines for potential security weaknesses, ensuring a secure software delivery process

* *Container Image scanning*: Scans container images for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and malware to secure your containerized applications

==== Seamless Integration

Prisma Cloud leverages existing workflows by integrating with your development environment through:

* *Web UI*: The central platform for initiating scans, managing findings, and configuring security policies

* *Integrated Development Environment (IDE)*: Provides security feedback directly within your development environment

* *Command Line Interface (CLI)*: Enables scripting and automation of security tasks
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Provides security feedback directly within your development environment

* *Version Control System (VCS)*: Integrates with your version control system to scan default or non-default branches containing open Pull Requests (PR) or Merge Requests (MR). In addition the system also performs periodic scans on specific branches within each repository.  

=== Visibility and Insights

* *Technical DNA*: Maps your software engineering ecosystem, including programming languages, frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, and plugins. This comprehensive overview allows for a deeper understanding of your development environment

* *Supply Chain Security*: Provides an inventory and visualization of application dependencies, offering a clear view of your software's supply chain

* *Enhanced Analysis*: The comprehensive scanning capabilities and visibility features empower you to gain valuable insights into various components of your engineering environment. This enables you to:
** Monitor security posture
** Analyze potential security risks
** Implement tailored security measures
** Prioritize and address critical vulnerabilities

=== Remediation and Streamlined Security

Prisma Cloud Application Security equips you with powerful tools to address vulnerabilities and secure your code efficiently:

* *Automated Remediation*: Generates code fixes and patches to automatically address issues detected in your code
* *Integrated Security Reviews*: Offers pull request comments, fixes, and smart fixes that automate the security code review process and streamline remediation efforts
* *Policy Enforcement*: Out-of-the-box policies and guardrails help prevent the deployment of vulnerable or misconfigured code. Additionally, you can create custom policies to further enforce security best practices within your organization
* *Pipeline Hardening*: Enables implementation of recommended security controls to harden your CI/CD pipelines, enhancing the overall security of your software delivery process

Application Security seamlessly integrates into your software delivery chain, capturing crucial information such as programming languages and frameworks, CI/CD pipelines and plugins. It then maps this information to their respective repositories, creating a comprehensive "Technical DNA" of your software engineering ecosystem, including robust Supply Chain security, providing a comprehensive inventory and visualization of application dependencies through a graphical interface designed to bridge developer, operations, and security workstreams.
In addition, Application Security scans to detect Infrastructure-as-Code (IAC) resources, direct and indirect Software Composition Analysis (SCA) packages, and secrets declared in code.

This comprehensive visibility allows you to gain valuable insights into the various components of your engineering environment, enabling enhanced analysis, monitoring security and implementation of tailored security measures. It ensures that you can prioritize and address critical risks without disrupting your engineering processes. This ensures a complete understanding and security posture of your organization's engineering ecosystem.

You can run scans through various interfaces, including a dedicated command line interface (CLI), integrated development environment (IDE), and version control system (VCS). The Application Security automates security engineering by identifying cloud infrastructure misconfigurations and vulnerabilities across IaC, SCA , Secrets, as well as CI/CD risks in the pipeline. Investigative capabilities provided by Prisma Cloud complement the module, providing insights on how best to resolve misconfigurations, evaluating whether packages are vulnerable and secrets are valid, and identifying potential attack vectors on pipelines.

The Application Security also automatically generates code fixes and patches to address vulnerabilities and secure your code. It offers integrated pull request comments, fixes, and smart fixes that automate the security code review process and streamline remediation efforts.

Out of the box policies and guardrails, as well as an option to create custom policies, allow you to prevent the deployment of misconfigured, vulnerable or leaked code. They also enable the implementation of recommended pipeline hardening controls to enhance the security of your software delivery processes.
