== Integrate Prisma Cloud Code Security Plugin with IDEs

Integrate the Prisma Cloud Code Security plugin into your workflow with your IDE to directly scan your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files for misconfigurations, detect vulnerabilities in your software composition analysis (SCA) packages, identify exposed secrets, and uncover license violations while coding. 

For a list of supported technologies refer to xref:../supported-technologies.adoc[Supported Technologies].

This process seamlessly runs in the background without disrupting your coding experience. Remediation options include fixing, suppressing, or referring to documentation. Supported IDEs include VS Code and all JetBrains offerings (such as IntelliJ, PyCharm and so on).

NOTE: Not all remediation options are available for all findings or all type of scan category.

For more information on the Prisma Cloud plugin for *VS Code*, refer to xref:connect-vscode.adoc[VS Code].

For more information on the Prisma Cloud plugin for *JetBrains*, refer to xref:connect-jetbrains.adoc[JetBrains].
