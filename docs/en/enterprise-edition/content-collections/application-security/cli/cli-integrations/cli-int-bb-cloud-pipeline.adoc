== Integrate Checkov CLI with Bitbucket Cloud Pipelines

You can integrate checkov into your Bitbucket Cloud pipelines. This provides a simple, automatic way of applying policies to your Terraform code both during merge request review and as part of your build process.

=== Basic Setup

Add a new step in the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file in your repository as part of whichever pipelines are appropriate for you.

Here is a minimalistic example.

[source,yaml]
----
checkov: &checkov
  step:
    name: Checkov
    image:
      name: bridgecrew/checkov:latest
      entrypoint:
        - '/usr/bin/env'
        - 'PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin'
    script:
      - checkov -d .

pipelines:
  default:
    - <<: *checkov
----

=== Example Results

When your pipeline executes, it will run this job. If Checkov finds any issues, it will fail the build.

==== Pipeline Failure

For example, an S3 bucket that does not have versioning enabled. Checkov detects this and fails the job and pipeline.

This will comment on an associated merge request or fail the build depending on the context.

==== Pipeline Success

After the configuration is corrected, Checkov verifies that the issues have been resolved.
