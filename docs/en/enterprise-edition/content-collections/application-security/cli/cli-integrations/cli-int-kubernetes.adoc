== Integrate Checkov with Kubernetes
Checkov is built to scan static code and is typically used at build time. However, resources running in a Kubernetes cluster can be described in the same way as at build-time. This allows Checkov to run in a cluster with read-only access and report on the same violations.

=== Execution

To run Checkov in your cluster, you must have Kubernetes CLI access to the cluster.

To execute a job against your cluster, run the following manifest: `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/main/kubernetes/checkov-job.yaml`.

Review the job output:

[source,kubernetes]
----
kubectl get jobs -n checkov
kubectl logs job/checkov -n checkov
----
