== Getting Started

=== Installation Options

Installing Checkov is quick and straightforwardâ€”just install, configure input, and scan.

==== Install From PyPI Using Pip

`pip install checkov`

or

`pip3 install checkov`


==== Install on Alpine

In general, it is not recommended to use Alpine with larger Python projects, like Checkov, because of incompatible C extensions. Currently, Checkov can only be installed on Alpine with Python 3.11+, but it is not officially tested or supported.

[source,python]
----
pip3 install --upgrade pip && pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
pip3 install checkov 
----

==== Install with Homebrew

Install with Homebrew

[source,sh]
----
brew install checkov
----

=== Upgrading Checkov

* With *pip3*: `pip3 install -U checkov` 


* With *Homebrew*: `brew upgrade checkov`  

=== Configure an Input Folder or File

==== Configure a Folder

`checkov --directory /user/path/to/iac/code`

==== Configure a Specific File

`checkov --file /user/tf/example.tf`

==== Configure Multiple Specific Files

`checkov -f /user/cloudformation/example1.yml -f /user/cloudformation/example2.yml`

==== Configure a Terraform Plan file in JSON

[source,terraform]
----
terraform init
terraform plan -out tf.plan
terraform show -json tf.plan  > tf.json 
checkov -f tf.json
----

NOTE: The Terraform show output file `tf.json` will be a single line. Consequently, Checkov will report all findings as occurring on line number 0.

[source,terraform]
----
check: CKV_AWS_21: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket have versioning enabled"
	FAILED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.customer
	File: /tf/tf.json:0-0
	Guide: https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/policy-reference/aws-policies/s3-policies/s3-16-enable-versioning

----

If you have installed jq, you can convert a JSON file into multiple lines with the command `terraform show -json tf.plan | jq '.' > tf.json`, making it easier to read the scan result.
