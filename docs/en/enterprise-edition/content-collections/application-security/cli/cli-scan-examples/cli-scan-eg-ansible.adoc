== Scan Ansible Configurations

Checkov supports the evaluation of policies on your Ansible files. When using checkov to scan a directory that contains Ansible tasks it will validate if the file is compliant with Ansible best practices such as validating certificates and using HTTPS to download files, and more.

Full list of Ansible policies checks can be found here.
//TODO: Add ref link to Ansible policies and replace here with the name of the doc
