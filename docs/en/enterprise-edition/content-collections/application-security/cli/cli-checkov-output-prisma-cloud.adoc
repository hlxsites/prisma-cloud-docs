== Checkov Output on Prisma Cloud Console


[.task]
Integrate Checkov with Prisma Cloud to view the results of Checkov scans in Prisma Cloud.

[.procedure]

. xref:../../../../administration/create-access-keys.adoc[Generate and copy the Prisma Cloud access key] to enable access to Prisma Cloud. The access key includes a key ID and secret.

. Run Checkov: 
+
* Option 1: `checkov -d <directory> --bc-api-key <access key>::<secret key> --prisma-api-url <prisma api url> --repo-id <repo_id> --branch <branch>`

* Option 2: Use the `-f`` file flag: `checkov -f <file_1> <file_2> ... <file_n> --bc-api-key <access key>::<secret key> --prisma-api-url <prisma api url> --repo-id <repo_id> --branch <branch>`

The table below details the arguments used when executing the API token:
