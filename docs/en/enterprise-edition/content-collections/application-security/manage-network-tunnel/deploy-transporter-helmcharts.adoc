== Set Up Transporter Network Tunnels using Helm Charts

Deploying the Transporter network tunnel using using Helm charts provides automated and efficient configuration management. Transporter can be deployed in a new or existing cluster environment.

=== System Architecture

The following diagram displays Kubernetes deployment options.

image::application-security/transporter-k8s-usecases.png[]

As displayed, deployment options include encrypting traffic at either the pod or ingress level. You can omit encryption when interacting with both ingress and pod. You can also choose to interact directly with the service and pod without involving ingress.

=== Resiliency and Redundancy Considerations

* *Resiliency*: Transporter supports resiliency
* *Redundancy*: Transporter does not support redundancy. You cannot run multiple Docker Containers of the Transporter and then load balance between them. In addition, you cannot run more than replica sets of more than one pod. Therefore you should monitor the pod

=== Installation Options

You can install the Helm chart and set configurations through either the Helm install command on CLI or by https://bc-helm-charts-153454541801.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/transporter/transporter.zip[downloading] the Helm chart `values.yaml` file.

[#requirements]
=== Requirements

Before installing Transporter through either of the two methods outlined above, you must fulfill the following requirements:

* Fulfill the xref:manage-network-tunnel.adoc#requirements[Requirements] listed in xref:manage-network-tunnel.adoc[Manage Transporter (Network Tunnel)]

* Open firewall rules before deployment

* Ensure DNS resolution within the environment. Public DNS resolution is not required

* Have Administrator access to your VCS/Terraform Enterprise in order to create a webhook

* Have a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster (supported versions v1.18 - 1.27)

* Install the https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm client]

* Create a Kubernetes resource for TLS secrets containing the certificate and private key when enabling TLS on the Transporter client pod or ingress controller
+
EXAMPLE: To create a TLS secret named: *transporter-tls* from local private.key and public.crt files run: `kubectl create secret tls transporter-tls --key private.key --cert public.crt`.

* Download the Transporter Client Helm chart: The available image tags are located in the following https://hub.docker.com/r/bridgecrew/transporter/tags[Docker Hub repository]
+
NOTE: To use a specific transporter image tag other than the latest version, uncomment the `image.tag` and set it to the required tag (for example, 0.0.5).

* *Transporter Name*: The Transporter name serves a dual purpose: it acts as a unique identifier to group and define multiple connections on Prisma Cloud, while also functioning as the ‘Alias’ required for the transporter to successfully connect to the correct customer tenant. This alias is essential, particularly when multiple transporters are configured on the tenant, ensuring seamless and accurate connections. The Transporter name cannot contain spaces
* *Transporter URL*: The URL that your firewall or proxies route to the Transporter at the port configured in the Port section
* *Port*: The Transporter URL is a proxy URL with a port number you must define. This information will also be used in the Docker files that are configured in Transporter to communicate with Prisma Cloud
* *Prisma Cloud Access Key ID*: The Access Key ID generated as part of the <<#requirements,Requirements>> above
* *Prisma Cloud Secret Key*: The Secret key generated as part of the <<#requirements,Requirements>> above
* *TLS Certificate path*: The path to the TLS certificate in order to use Transporter. Webhooks use the certificate path to integrate with Transporter. Ensure that the path is for the specified Transporter client URL and port
* *TLS Certificate key path*: The path to the TLS certificate key. Allows WebSockets to encrypt traffic (communicate over HTTP). 
* *Provider Self Signed CA certificate path (Optional)*: The path for the self-signed CA certificate of your VCS/Terraform Enterprise provider when using self-signed certificates. 
* *VPN/Proxy CA certificate path (Optional)*: The path for the self-signed CA certificate of your VPN/proxy provider when using self-signed certificates, if it differs from the self-signed certificate used by the provider

image::application-security/transporter-logs1.png[]


[.task]

[#install-yml]
=== Install Transporter through the `values.yaml` file

[.procedure]
. Execute *steps 1-8* of <<install-helm-cli,Install Transporter through Helm install command on CLI>> above.

. Configure the following Transporter ENVIRONMENT variables that were generated in *step 1* under the *transporter* section of the `values.yaml` file:
+
* *accessKey*: The Prisma Cloud access key
* *secretKey*: The Prisma Cloud secret key
* *serverUrl*: Transporter server URL (for example: wss://api0-transporter/wss/transporter)
* *transporterAlias*: The name (alias) that you assign to the Transporter
* *transporterUrl*: The URL of the Transporter client that serves as the endpoint for all requests from the VCS/Terraform Enterprise
+
NOTE: The Transporter URL is used by the VCS/Terraform Enterprise to access the transporter client. Ensure that name resolution is enabled on the VCS/Terraform Enterprise side and that it correctly resolves to the Transporter Client (that is, hosts file or DNS record).

. Customize your Helm chart by enabling TLS on the pod or configuring ingress with TLS.  

.. *Option #1: Deploy with TLS on the pod*
+
Prerequisite: To enable TLS on the Transporter client pod or ingress controller you need to create a TLS secret Kubernetes resource with the certificate and private key.
+
EXAMPLE: To create a TLS secret named: _transporter-tls_ from *local private.key* and *public.crt* files run: `kubectl create secret tls transporter-tls --key private.key --cert public.crt`.
+
Configure the following settings:
+
** *Set transporter.tls.enabled*: true
** *transporter.tls.secretName*: Use the TLS Kubernetes secret’s name
** *transporter.tls.certificate*: "tls.crt"
** *transporter.tls.key*: "tls.key"

.. *Option #2: Deploy with Ingress Enabled and TLS Configured on Ingress (Pod TLS Disabled)*
+
Configure the *ingress* section in the `values.yaml` as follows: 
+
** Enable ingress *ingress.enabled*: true.
** Modify the host address under *ingress.hosts*.
** Enable TLS on ingress:
*** Disable pod level TLS: set *transporter.tls.enabled*: false
*** Uncomment the `ingress.tls` section
*** Modify the `ingress.tls.secretName` with the value of the TLS secret’s name
*** Modify the host address under the `ingress.tls` section

. Modify Kubernetes Service settings under the *service* section of the `values.yaml` file. 
+
For example, if you want to switch from using the ClusterIP service type to the LoadBalancer service type, make the necessary changes in the `values.yaml` file.
+
EXAMPLE: Set the service to a different type (LoadBalancer) and port (8000):
+
[source,yml ]
---
service:
  	port: 8000
  	type: LoadBalancer 
---

. Modify the *resources* section to adjust the Kubernetes resource requests and limits according to your specifications. The chart uses the recommended minimum resource requests based on hardware limitations. 
+
NOTE: See prerequisites above for hardware limitations.

. Install the Helm chart: run: `helm install transporter` in the folder where you extracted the Helm chart ZIP file.

. Verify successful deployment by inspecting the Transporter logs. Refer to _step 5_ of <<install-helm-cli,Install Transporter using the Helm install command in the CLI>> above.

=== Verify Deployment and Connectivity

You can verify that the transporter has been successfully deployed and is connected to your providers through both the Prisma Cloud console and your CLI. 

* *Prisma Cloud console*: In *Application Security* select *Home* > *Settings > Manage Network Tunnels > Manage Integrations*. Select that your Transporter in the *Transporter* field, and verify connectivity by checking for a displayed message
+
image::application-security/transporter-verify-connectivity-ui1.1.png[]

* *CLI*: To retrieve logs in your Kubernetes environment displaying the establishment of a connection between the Transporter and your provider, run `kubectl logs [POD_NAME] -c [CONTAINER_NAME]`.  

=== Health Check

The health check provides about the VCS/Terraform Enterprise integrations and the most recent connection establishment time. The Transporter runs health checks every hour, and you manually refresh the connection at any time through Prisma Cloud.

For more on health checks see xref:transporter-health-check.adoc[Transporter Health Check]. 

=== Enable Logs

Configure logging to capture and store system events, errors, and activities for analysis and troubleshooting purposes through both CLI commands and the `values.yaml` file. By default, the logging level is set to `info`. You can customize the logging level by adjusting the `logLevel` parameter. Example: `--set transporter.logLevel=debug`.

* *CLI commands*: To enable logging through CLI commands, add this parameter: `--set transporter.logLevel=debug` in either *step 2* option #1 Deploy with TLS on the pod or option #2 Deploy with Ingress Enabled and TLS Configured on Ingress (Pod TLS Disabled) from the <<#install-helm-cli,Install Transporter using the Helm install command in the CLI>> section above   
* *values.yaml* file: Logging values are pre-configured in the `values.yaml` chart file
