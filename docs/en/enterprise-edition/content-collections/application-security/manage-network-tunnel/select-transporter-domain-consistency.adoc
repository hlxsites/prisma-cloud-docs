== Select Transporter and ensure Domain Name Consistency 

When integrating your self-hosted provider, such as GitLab Self-Managed, GitHub Server, Terraform Enterprise (Run Tasks) and so on with Prisma Cloud using a Transporter, it is essential to maintain consistency in the domain name. This means matching the domain name that you provided during integration with the domain configuration set up for the Transporter. Additionally, you must select the appropriate Transporter as part of the configuration process.
