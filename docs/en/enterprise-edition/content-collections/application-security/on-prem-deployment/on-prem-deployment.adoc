== On-Premises Deployment

*WIP*

Prisma Cloud On Premises (on-prem) solution allows customers to use Cloud Application Security modules without sending sensitive code outside of customer premise 
The solution will allow running the scans on a local deployment with the ability to view and work with the Prisma Cloud platform experience.
The solution will use a container Orchestrator that will run scanners locally on the customer K8s environment.
