== Pull Request Scans

Pull request scans are event driven scans triggered by version control systems such as GitHub, GitLab Bitbucket and Azure Repos, or webhooks that are run on branches with open Pull Requests (PR) or Merge Requests (MR) from your integrated repositories, including both . The scan results are based on the default *Enforcement* thresholds or custom configurations.

NOTE: Pull request scans run automatically on the default branch of your repositories. To scan non-default branches, manual configuration is required. For more on non-default branch scans, refer to xref:../../get-started/non-default-branch-scan.adoc [Non-default branch scans]

=== Configure Pull Request Scans

Configure PR scan settings using the *Comment Bot Enforcement* threshold.

[.procedure]

. Before you begin, configure branch protection rules in your Version Control System (VCS) to fail builds if a step fails. 

. In *Application Security* select *Projects* > *Action* menu.
. Select *Enforcement* from the menu.

. In a code category, drag the *Comments bot* threshold rule arrow to your required severity.
+
The 'hard-fail level' sets the threshold for failing a pull request (PR) scan conducted by Prisma Cloud. When the severity of a finding is at or above this threshold, the PR scan will fail, and PR comments will be added. This ensures that any identified issues meeting or exceeding the specified severity threshold will result in a failed PR scan and the addition of comments to the PR. For more information on Enforcement, refer to xref:enforcement.adoc[Enforcement].

=== Manage Pull Request Scan Results

You can manage pull request scan results within the pull request itself or through the Prisma Cloud Console.

==== On the Pull Request

Errors detected by a PR scan triggered by changes to a resource are displayed as a PR comment within the pull request. Details of the error and suggested remediation can be viewed by clicking the arrow in the comment.

NOTE: SCA PR comments are for any vulnerability in a modified package manager file. Secrets PR comments are only for new or modified lines of code that include a secret finding.

NOTE: 

During pull request (PR) scans, Prisma Cloud reviews all modified resources within the PR. However, due to constraints in many version control systems (VCS), comments can only be added to modified lines. Despite this limitation, the scanner accurately identifies the relevant lines for each comment. It's important to note that scan results are not filtered on a line-by-line basis, so results for other lines in the same resource may also be provided, even if only one line was changed.

This approach is particularly valuable for customers who already have existing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with identified issues. By identifying these issues during pull requests when changes are made, Prisma Cloud can expedite the resolution of older issues. While this may introduce additional notifications, it ensures that issues within actively modified resources are not overlooked.

==== On the Prisma Cloud Console

In addition, you can view results of a pull request scan on the Prisma Cloud console: In *Application Security*, select *Projects* and click the *VCS Pull Requests* tab.
