== License Compliance in Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

Open source software licenses define the terms under which open source software can be used, modified, and distributed. Therefore, when selecting an open source package, it's crucial to understand the types of licenses and the associated user restrictions to mitigate any potential compliance issues.

In Prisma Cloud, licenses are scanned as part of the Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerability scan for open source packages. License restrictions for each package are determined either at the root package (direct dependent package) or at the sub-dependent package level. 

NOTE: By default, License policies are disabled. To enable them, refer to <<#enable-disable-license,Enable/Disable License Policies>> below. 

=== License Types

Prisma Cloud offers three types of default License policies out of the box, providing comprehensive coverage for managing license compliance within your environment. Within each license type, SPDX identifiers are organized and sorted based on their characteristics and attributes. This sorting method helps effectively categorize and identify software packages distributed under each specific license type, enabling precise management of license compliance.

* *Weak Copyleft Licenses* policies (*Medium* severity): Identifies software packages distributed under weak copyleft licenses. These licenses permit combining code with other licenses, including proprietary licenses, without mandating the entire derivative work to be released under the same copyleft license

* *Strong Copyleft Licenses* policies (*High* severity): Identifies software packages distributed under strong copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL). These licenses require derivative works to be distributed under the same copyleft license terms as the original work. This ensures broader access and modification rights

* *Non Permissive Licenses* policies (*High* severity): Identifies software packages distributed under non-permissive or restrictive licenses. These licenses restrict how you can use, modify, and distribute the software. They might limit your ability to integrate the software into certain projects or require you to purchase a commercial license for specific uses

For more information on default License policies refer to https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/policy-reference/license-policies/license-policies[License Policies].
 

In addition, you can create custom license policies to suit your organization's requirements. See <<#custom-policies,Create Custom License Policies>> below for more information.

==== Guidelines

* License policies use YAML query syntax and follow the same query rules as IaC policies. For example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
    guidelines: "My policy guidelines"
    category: license
scope:
    provider: "aws"
definition:
 or:
  - cond_type: "attribute"
    resource_types:
    - "some_resource"
    attribute: "hello"
    operator: "exists"
----

* *Logical operators* include `and, or, not`

* *Conditions* 

** *attribute*: attribute / value check (equals, contains, and so on). See <<#attribute-cond-oper,Attribute Condition Operators>> below for more information
** *connection*: Check connected resource types
** *Filter*: Selects resources from a connection

* The *provider* must be a supported value
* The *resource type* does not have to be from a supported or default provider as it is a policy metadata field

==== Definition Structure

* Child of definition must be a single and, or, not, or a condition (not a list)
* Child of `and / or`` must be a list of `and, or, not``, or condition(s)
* Child of `not`` must be a single `and, or, not``, or a condition (can be a list of length 1)

==== Definition Examples

=== Integrations

You can view License non-compliance scan results for packages in your VCS repositories.
//to be checked


=== Pull Request Comment Support for License Policies

Prisma Cloud supports Pull Request (PR) comment notifications for license policy violations. These violations are detected during scans of PRs. If violations are found, the system generates comments on the PR to notify the developer about the detected issues.


////
Open source software licenses define how you can use, modify and distribute the open source software. Thus, when selecting an open source package to merge to your code it is imperative to understand the types of licenses and the user restrictions the package falls under, which helps you mitigate any compliance issues.
On Prisma Cloud, licenses are scanned in parallel to the vulnerability scan for open source packages to understand usage restrictions. For every package license restrictions are defined either at the root package (direct dependent package) or sub-dependent package.
In addition, Prisma Cloud supports an OOTB (Out-Of-The-Box) license policy (for example, BC_LIC_1) where all https://spdx.org/licenses/[SPDX] licenses with http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical[OSI] approval are considered compliant during the scan. If a violation occurs with an unknown license, private license or the license is not a part of the approved list, then a different policy is created to monitor it (for example, BC_LIC_2).
On the console you can suppress license violations or manually fix them by choosing another, compliant package.

=== Review license compliance violations
License violations for SCA scans are reviewed on *Projects*. You can also view the violations on DevOps including integrations of IDEs, VCS or CI/CD runs with Checkov.

* *Integrations*
+
You can view license compliance scan results for packages in your VCS repositories or IDE.
In this example, you see the VS Code displaying licensing compliance violations in the terminal.
+
image::application-security/sca-20.png[]

* *Checkov*
+
During your code development you can identify license compliance violations by running a Checkov scan CLI.
For each CLI run, you see information on license violations with the package name, package version, policy ID, license type and status of the violation.
+
In this example, you see the scan result of a Checkov CLI run for an SCA scan with information on licensing violations.
+
image::application-security/sca-21.png[]

* *Projects*
+
Similar to the scan results of SCA package vulnerabilities, license violations are also contextualized and monitored on the Prisma Cloud console from *Projects*. Here each policy violation is a single error including license compliance violations in sub-dependent packages.
+
In this example, you see the scan result of a license violation with contextualized information of the vulnerability in *Resource Explorer > Errors*.
+
image::application-security/sca-22.png[]
////
////
In this example, you see the scan result of a license sub-dependent violation with contextualized information in *Resource Explorer > Details* where you can also see the list of direct dependencies.
+
image::application-security/sca-23.png[]
////
////

[.task]

=== Suppress license compliance violations

To remediate an SCA scan policy violation, you can initiate suppression on the console from *Projects*. Suppressing policy effectively exempts it from detection during the subsequent scan. However, this requires a suppression rule, which mandates a clear and definitive explanation why the violation is considered non-critical.

Within each suppression rule, you must outline both the *Suppression Type* and the relevant *License Type*, as it impacts of the rule.

There are two primary categories of Suppression Types:

* *License Types*: Allows you to absolve the violation based on the specific license associated with the resource.
* *Package*: Allows you to suppress any license violations tied to a specified package.

By employing suppression, you can effectively tailor your response to SCA policy violations.

[.procedure]

. On *Projects* and then select *Licenses* view.

. Access a specific license vulnerability to suppress.

. Add a suppression rule.

.. On the side panel select *Issues*.

.. Select *Suppress*.
+
image::application-security/sca-26.png[]

.. Add a justification as a definitive explanation for suppressing the specific vulnerability.
+
You can optionally add an *Expiration Date* for the suppression and then select *Apply*.

.. Select *Suppression Type*.

.. Select *License types*.
+
License types are subjective to the open source package, where you can define the suppression only to the identified license.
+
In this example, you see the package has one license `LGPLV2.1`.
+
image::application-security/sca-30.png[]

. Select *Save* to save the suppression rule.
