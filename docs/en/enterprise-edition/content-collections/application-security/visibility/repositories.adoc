== Repositories

The *Repositories* page provides a comprehensive repository-centric view of your engineering environment. This consolidated view helps you:

* Identify and analyze the technologies used across your projects, such as code repositories and their associated infrastructure including programming languages, frameworks and CI files, as well as your paths to production

* Gain insights into security posture. 'Repositories' maps your organization's security posture, allowing you to understand the high and critical risks in your repositories 

* Leverage the <<app-graph,Application Graph>>, which visually maps your repositories and their connections, providing deeper insights into your environment. This visual representation helps you identify potential issues and dependencies that may not be observable by a single-repository view 

NOTE: The repositories displayed in the inventory are limited to those selected during VCS onboarding. To ensure complete visibility, it is recommended to select all repositories during VCS onboarding. Users will only see repositories to which they have been granted access, based on their designated roles and permissions.

=== User Repository CI/CD Scan Limitation

Prisma Cloud's CI/CD scan capabilities differ between organization repositories and user repositories. Unlike organization repositories, Prisma Cloud's CI/CD security for user repositories offers limited functionality, as scans are limited to fetching *Workspace* data (members, collaborators information and commit history) and *Repository* data (collaborators, repository contributors and repository commits history). Advanced CI/CD security scan features are not supported for user repositories.

//See xref:getting-started.adoc#manage-role-permission[Manage Roles and Permissions]for more.

To access *Repositories*, in *Application Security* select *Home* > *Repositories*. An inventory of your repositories in your organization is displayed.

[#repo-importance-score]
=== Repository Importance Priority Score

The 'Repository Importance Score' provides a data-driven approach to prioritize security efforts across multiple code repositories by quantifying each repository's significance. Repository scores are calculated based on various factors, including codebase characteristics and path-to-production environments. These factors include, but are not limited to:

//* *Repository commits*: Includes the total number of commits, the number of commits over the last *X* months, and the time of the last commit 
//* *Repository Issues*: Includes the total number of issues detected in a repository, and the last time an issue was reported
//* *Repository releases/tags*: Includes the total number of tags and releases, and the last time a tag or release was created 
//* *Repository characteristics*: Includes whether the repository was forked, if it is private or public, if it is part of your organization and whether it is archived

* *Repository commits*: The frequency of code changes indicates potential areas of ongoing development and potential security risks
* *Number of issues*: The presence of vulnerabilities (SCA), weaknesses (SAST), and secrets identified within the repository
* *Repository characteristics*: Whether the repository is private, part of the organization or only a user repository, and more
* *Number of releases*: Repositories with frequent releases might have a higher impact on production environments. The last release date indicates activity
* *Number of contributors*: A larger contributor base suggests broader code ownership and potentially greater attack surface
* *Repository relationships*: Includes all collaborators, CI files, connected pipelines (including whether they build an image), and whether the repository is associated with a container  (repo > pipeline > image > container) 

Additionally, this score can be customized to accommodate your organization's specific security priorities, allowing you to weigh these factors differently based on your unique security needs. For more information refer to <<custom-repo-importance,Custom Repository Importance Scores>> below.

By leveraging this scoring system, teams can understand the relative importance of repositories. This enables them to effectively allocate security resources and prioritize addressing issues in the most critical repositories first, safeguarding the safety of business-critical functionalities. You can view the Repository Importance Score under the *Priority Level* column. 


//Alt name: Repository Importance Priority Score, Prioritize Repositories





////
Security management across code repositories presents a growing challenge as codebases expand and teams adopt microservices architectures. Efficient resource allocation for security efforts hinges on identifying the critical repositories that require the most attention in order to allocate resources effectively.  

The Repository Score is a dynamic metric designed to address the challenges of prioritizing security issues within a multi-repository environment. By incorporating factors like repository maintenance frequency, characteristics, path to production and more, Repository Score provides a quantitative measure (1-10) to guide security teams towards the most impactful remediation efforts. This data-driven approach empowers developers to optimize security resource allocation and focus on vulnerabilities that pose the greatest risk. The data collection processes is automated and scheduled at regular intervals to ensure that scores are based on the latest information.

You can filter CAS findings and insights based on the Code Repository Importance Score across Project, CI/CD Risks, SBOM, and Technologies pages to focus on repositories with higher importance.


In the fast-paced world of software development, our customers face significant challenges in efficiently prioritizing security issues across their numerous code repositories. Without a clear understanding of which repositories are most actively used and critical to their operations, it becomes difficult to allocate resources effectively. To address this, we introduce the Repo Score—an innovative solution designed to streamline decision-making processes for security teams.

The Repo Score is a dynamic, actionable metric ranging from 1 to 100 that quantifies the active usage and significance of each integrated code repository relative to others. By providing a clear measure of a repository's importance and priority, this score empowers security teams to focus their efforts on the most crucial areas first, ensuring that resources are allocated where they are needed most. With the Repo Score, our objective is to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in managing and mitigating security risks within code repositories, ultimately contributing to a more secure and robust software development lifecycle.
