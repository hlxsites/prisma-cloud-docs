== Package Dependency Graph

Prisma Cloud's *Investigate* feature offers a Package Dependency graph. This graphical representation of your xref:sbom.adoc[SBOM] allows you to explore package dependencies in your code repositories through the xref:../../../search-and-investigate/application-asset-queries/application-asset-queries.adoc[Simple Mode Query] builder. You can investigate both transitive and intransitive packages, including their licenses and vulnerabilities. 

//For transitive packages, you can view their dependency tree by clicking on the 'indirect' connection edge.

*Requirement*:  To use the graph, you must first enable the CAS SCA module. For more information on SCA licenses, refer to xref:../../../administration/prisma-cloud-licenses.adoc[Prisma Cloud License Types].

//Other use cases of the Supply Chain graph, like Image Referencer and IaC Resources Exploration, are not yet integrated into the Application Asset Graph.

=== Legend

* Numbers next to the VCS Repository node: represent the grouping and amount or repositories containing the package file

* Numbers next to the PackageFile node: represent the grouping and amount of package files depending on the package

* Numbers next to the Package node: represent the grouping and amount of packages including the CVE vulnerability

* The edges describe the relationships between the nodes

* Clicking on a number expands the node, allowing you to drill-down for additional details by clicking on each child entity 

* Clicking on a vulnerability displays its details, such as severity, CVSS score, impacted stages and more
