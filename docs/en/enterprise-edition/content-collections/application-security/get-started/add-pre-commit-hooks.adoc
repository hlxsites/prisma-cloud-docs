== Pre-commit Hooks

Install Prisma Cloud Application Security scanner (Prisma Cloud scanner) as a pre-commit hook into your workflows to automate the scanning of your code for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) issues and Secrets vulnerabilities before a commit is created locally. Pre-commit hooks are local hooks that are triggered on the local machine before a commit is created or on other supported Git actions, such as file staging. These hooks enable you to enforce checks or actions before accepting any changes into the VCS.

=== Install Prisma Cloud Scanner as a Pre-Commit Hook on a Local Machine

[.procedure]

[#prerequisites]
==== Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python] v3.9 - v3.13
- (If using Docker image method) https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker]
- https://pre-commit.com/#install[pre-commit]
- xref:../../connect-code-and-build-providers/ci-cd-runs/add-checkov.adoc[Checkov]

Ensure the Prisma Cloud user has one of the following roles or equivalent permissions:

-  *Developer*, *Systems Admin*, or *AppSec Admin* role
- Alternatively, for *GRBAC*, provide the following permissions in a https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/administration/create-custom-permission-groups[Permission Group].
+
* __Policies__: *Policies* - 'View' permissions
* __Application Security__: *Projects* - 'View' permissions
* __Settings__: *Providers* - ('View' and 'Create') OR ('View' and 'Update') permissions

For information about roles and permissions on Prisma Cloud, refer to xref:../../administration/prisma-cloud-admin-permissions.adoc[Prisma Cloud Administrator Permissions].

[#installation]
==== Installation

. Set your Prisma Cloud credentials as environment variables.
NOTE: This is the recommended security practice. Do not hardcode credentials in your pre-commit hook due to security risks.

*Mac/Linux*
[source,shell]
----
export BC_API_KEY=<Your Prisma Cloud Access Key>::<Your Prisma Cloud Secret Key>
export PRISMA_API_URL=<Your Prisma Cloud API URL> # Example: https://api3.prismacloud.io
----

*Windows*
[source,shell]
----
set BC_API_KEY=<Your Prisma Cloud Access Key>::<Your Prisma Cloud Secret Key>
set PRISMA_API_URL=<Your Prisma Cloud API URL> # Example: https://api3.prismacloud.io
----

. Create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root directory of your repository.

NOTE: To configure Prisma Cloud code scanning as a pre-commit hook, you have several options. This section details the most basic configuration, which scans the entire repository whenever a Terraform file is modified. For alternative configurations, see <<alternative-configs,Alternative configuration options>> below.
Recommended: To avoid redundant results uploads, append the --skip-results-upload flag to your pre-commit hook configuration.

[source,yaml]
----
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov.git
    rev: '3.2.390' # It is recommended to change to tag or sha, such as 3.2.390
    hooks:
      - id: checkov # Alternatively, use checkov_container for an image based scan
        args: [--skip-results-upload, --repo-id, organization/repository, --use-enforcement-rules]
----

. Optional: add additional configuration settings to the args section of your .pre-commit-config.yaml file, such as --framework and --skip-check
.
For a complete list of configuration options, refer to the xref:https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/CLI%20Command%20Reference.html[Checkov CLI Command Reference].

. Install the hook: Run:

[source,shell]
----
pre-commit install --install-hooks
----

. Test pre-commit functionality: Modify a file that is tracked by Git, and execute the git commit command.
.
Confirm that the pre-commit hook is triggered and that it either allows the commit or blocks it based on the results of its checks.

[#alternative-configs]
=== Alternative configuration options

Pre-commit hooks offer multiple configuration options. Some examples are provided below.

==== Secrets scanning only

Prevent secrets from being exposed in pull requests by identifying and blocking them before they are committed.

[source,yaml]
----
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov.git
    rev: '3.2.390'  # update the tag or use a sha
    hooks:
      - id: checkov_secrets  # Alternatively, use checkov_secrets_container
        args: [--skip-results-upload, --repo-id, organization/repository, --use-enforcement-rules, -f]
----

==== Scan modified files only

This configuration scans only modified files. Cross-file checks should be disabled due to potential limitations.

[source,yaml]
----
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov.git
    rev: '3.2.390'  # update the tag or use a sha
    hooks:
      - id: checkov_diff  # Alternatively, use checkov_diff_container
        args: [--skip-results-upload, --repo-id, organization/repository, --use-enforcement-rules, --skip-check, "CKV2*", -f]
----

==== Complete override

You can fully override the entrypoint to customize configuration options.

[source,yaml]
----
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov.git
    rev: '3.2.390'  # update the tag or use a sha
    hooks:
      - id: checkov_diff
        entry: checkov --framework cloudformation --skip-results-upload --repo-id organization/repository --use-enforcement-rules -d .
