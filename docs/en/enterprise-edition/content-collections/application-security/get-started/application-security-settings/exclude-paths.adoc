== Exclude Paths from Application Security Scans

By default, Prisma Cloud conducts scans across all paths in all repositories. You can apply a rule to exclude paths during a scan, and select the repositories to which these exclusions apply.

//Prior to initiating the rule-addition process, ensure that the default configuration for all repositories is disabled.
//TODO: Anagha to confirm this statement.
