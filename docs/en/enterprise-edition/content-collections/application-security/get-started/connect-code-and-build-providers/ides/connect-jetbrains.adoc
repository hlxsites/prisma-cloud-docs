== Add Prisma Cloud Code Security Plugin to JetBrains IDE

Integrate the Prisma Cloud Code Security plugin (plugin) for JetBrains IDEs (IDE) to seamlessly enhance security while coding, allowing you to identify issues before you commit your code, reducing the risk of pull requests failing due to undetected issues. Prisma Cloud scans for security policy violations based on both default, out-of-the-box and custom policies.

For default policies, refer to the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/policy-reference/get-started-code-sec-policies/get-started-code-sec-policies[Policies] documentation.

For information on creating custom policies, refer to xref:../../../../governance/custom-build-policies/custom-build-policies.adoc[Custom Build Policies].

The plugin utilizes Prisma Cloud's capabilities to scan these security categories:

* IaC misconfigurations in IaC templates such as Kubernetes and Terraform. For a list of supported IaC frameworks see xref:../../../supported-technologies.adoc[Supported Technologies]
* SCA vulnerabilities: Includes security issues in both direct and transitive open-source dependencies
* Secrets: Security vulnerabilities in your base images
* Licenses: Software license noncompliance

You can prioritize findings and address the most critical issues by filtering the scan results based on severity.

NOTE: The Prisma Cloud Code Security plugin supports all JetBrains products.

=== Prerequisites

//[.procedure]

. Install https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python] v3.7 or above, https://docs.pipenv.org/[Pipenv], or a running https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker] daemon.

=== Scans 

Code scans can be performed on an entire project or selected files.

* *Full scan*: Click either *Scan* or the *Play* button in the *Problems Tool* to initiate a scan of the entire project 

* *File scan*: Open or save a specific file to trigger a scan exclusively for that file

==== Cancel a Scan

You can cancel a scan by clicking the red *Cancel* button that replaces the *Play* button when starting a scan. After cancelling a scan, results from the previous scan remain.

[#analyze-results]
=== Findings

You can manage findings through either the *Code editor* or the *Problems Tool*. 

image::application-security/scan-results-masked.png[]

////
Issues detected during a scan, including context and impact,are displayed in the Code editor and Problems Tool. Scan results include summary details of the violating policies, expanded details (in the Problems Tool) and options to fix, suppress, or a link to documentation including guidelines on remediating the issue based on the Prisma Cloud Code Security fix dictionaries.
////

//==== View and Filter Findings


==== Manage Findings through the Code editor 

* *IaC* misconfigurations: The red marker indicating an error is displayed on the first line of a resource block. Select the marker to view the issue, including its name, severity, and affected lines of code. If applicable, line(s) of code displaying the fix are shown, illustrating the correction, or a code diff highlighting the changes between the error and the fix may be provided. If there are multiple issues in a resource, the total count of issues is displayed, and an arrow enables scrolling through them. In addition, remediation options are displayed. To display a detailed view of the issue in the Problems Tool, click *Console*.   

NOTE: A resource block declares a resource of a given type with a given local name. The name is used to refer to this resource from elsewhere in the same Terraform module, but has no significance outside of the scope of a module.

[#remediation]
=== Remediation

You can mitigate issues directly through both the *Code editor* or the *Problems Tool*. Options include *Fix*, *Suppress*, or *Documentation*. 

NOTE: Not all types of remediation are available for all issues.

==== Fixes

When selecting an issue in either the Code editor or Problems Tool, you can apply automatic fixes, if available, by clicking *Fix*. The following list displays the type of fix available for the different categories of issues.

* *IaC misconfigurations*: The fix modifies the configuration. If an automatic fix is not available you can use the suggested fix to manually address the code issue 
* *SCA vulnerabilities*: The fix bumps the package version. You can directly fix the specific CVE vulnerability that has been detected during the scan by upgrading the package to the version that includes a fix. You can fix all of the CVE vulnerabilities found in a package by selecting *Fix All* in the *Problems Tool*. This fix upgrades the package to a version that addresses all the issues
* *Secrets* issues: Follow the policy guidelines
* *License* mis-compliance: Follow the policy guidelines

==== Suppression

Suppress an issue to temporarily hide or ignore an issue without fixing it, allowing you to concentrate on more important issues.

NOTE: The suppression is scoped to the file.

. Before you begin, enable *Developer Suppressions* on the Prisma Cloud console.
.. In *Application Security*, select *Settings* > *Application Security* under 'Configure' in the left navbar.
.. Scroll down to *Developer Suppressions* and toggle the switch button *ON*.
. In the IDE, select an issue > *Suppress* from either the Code editor or Problems Tool.
. Provide a justification for the suppression> *OK*.
+
NOTE: The justification will be added as a commented annotation to your source code.

After suppressing an issue, the file is not scanned for two minutes. This is to prevent the issue from being re-triggered. Saving the file during the hold period will not trigger a scan.

For more information on Suppression, refer to the xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/suppress-code-issues.adoc[Suppression] documentation.

==== Documentation

If automated fixes are not available, policy documentation can provide guidance on how to address the issue: 
Select an issue > *Documentation*.
You are redirected to the relevant policy documentation which includes suggested guidelines on how to solve the issue.
