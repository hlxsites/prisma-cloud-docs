== Add Prisma Cloud Application Security Plugin to VS Code IDE

Integrate the Prisma Cloud Code Security plugin (Prisma Cloud) for VS Code IDE to seamlessly enhance security while coding, allowing you to identify issues before you commit your code, reducing the risk of pull requests failing due to undetected issues. Prisma Cloud scans for security policy violations based on both default, out-of-the-box and custom policies.

For default policies, refer to the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/policy-reference/get-started-code-sec-policies/get-started-code-sec-policies[Policies] documentation.

For information on creating custom policies, refer to xref:../../../../governance/custom-build-policies/custom-build-policies.adoc[Custom Build Policies].

The plugin utilizes Prisma Cloud's capabilities to scan these security categories:

* IaC misconfigurations in IaC templates such as Kubernetes and Terraform. For a list of supported IaC frameworks see xref:../../../supported-technologies.adoc[Supported Technologies]
* SCA vulnerabilities: Includes security issues in both direct and transitive open-source dependencies
* Secrets: Security vulnerabilities in your base images
* Licenses: Software license noncompliance

You can prioritize findings and address the most critical issues by filtering the scan results based on severity.

=== Prerequisites

//[.procedure]

. Install https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python] v3.7 or above, https://docs.pipenv.org/[Pipenv], or a running https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker] daemon.
+
NOTE: The Prisma Cloud plugin automatically invokes the latest version of Prisma Cloud Code Security.

. On Prisma Cloud.
+
* Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud console 
* xref:../../../../administration/create-access-keys.adoc[Generate and copy the Prisma Cloud access key] to enable access to Prisma Cloud. The access key includes a key ID and secret
* Retrieve your Prisma Cloud API URL, which varies depending on the region and cluster on which your tenant is deployed
+
NOTE: For Prisma Cloud API URL, replace *app* in the URL with *api*.

image::application-security/vscode-ui-overview1.2.png[]

* Left pane: The navigation bar features a tree structure displaying issues by security category (IaC misconfigurations, Secrets, Vulnerabilities (SCA), and Licenses). Each category expands to reveal folders containing specific issues detected during a scan
* Middle pane: The *Code editor*. Allows you to review your codebase and view a list of findings related to a resource (for IaC misconfigurations) or file, along with remediation options
* Right pane: The *Problems Tool*. Provides a detailed view of a selected issue, including information such as the code difference when available, and remediation options 

=== Usage

The Prisma Cloud Security extension allows you to conduct comprehensive scans, manage findings efficiently, and remediate issues, all within your coding environment.

==== Scans

Code scans can be performed on an entire project or selected files.

* *Full scan*: Click the *Play* button in any of the security categories (IaC, Secrets and so on) in the navigation bar to initiate a  scan of the entire project
+
NOTE: Although you initiate the scan by selecting the Play button within a single category, the scan covers all security categories.

* *File scan*: Open or save a specific file to trigger a scan exclusively for that file

=== Findings

Easily manage security issues discovered during scans.

//==== View and Filter Findings

* *Navigation bar*: Findings are grouped by security category in the *Navigation Bar* for easy browsing. Click on a specific folder or subsequent subfolders to view all the findings within that folder. Select an issue to reveal details in both the Code editor and Problems Tool. You can filter findings by severity, by selecting the filter icon next to a security category. Severity values: 'Critical', 'High', 'Medium', 'Low' amd 'Info' 

//==== Understanding Findings

* *Code Editor*: Red markers indicate the location of issues in code lines or resources. Hover for details and remediation options. Select *Console* to display the issue in more detail in the Problems Tool
+
image::application-security/vscode-editor-findings1.1.png[]

* *Problems Tool*: Provides a detailed view of selected issues, including available remediation options. You can access the Problems Tool by selecting an issue in the navigation bar or through the *Console* option in the Code editor
+
NOTE: You may need to scroll down the Problem Tools pane to access remediation options.
+

////
Issues detected during a scan are displayed in the navigation bar for easy access, grouped by security category. Selecting an issue reveals its details, context, impact, and a summary of the violating policies in both the Code editor and the Problems Tool. Both Code Editor and Problems Tool offer remediation options, including fix, suppress, or a link to documentation. The Problems Tool additionally provides expanded details about the issue. See <<#remediation,Remediation>> below for more information. 

Filter findings by category to narrow a search for the most critical issues that need to be addressed.

image::application-security/vscode-findings1.0.png[]

* In the *Navigation bar*: Findings are displayed according to a security category. Selecting a finding opens it in both the Code editor and the Problems Tool 
* In the *Code editor*: When issues are detected in a resource (for IaC) or in a file, a red mark or indicator is displayed in the code line next to the resource. Hover over the line starting with the resource to display a list of findings related to the particular resource, including the issue's context and impact, as well as available fixes. Selecting *Console* displays a detailed view of the issue in the Problems Tool. In addition, the navigation bar opens to the corresponding resource
+
NOTE: A resource block declares a resource of a given type with a given local name. The name is used to refer to this resource from elsewhere in the same Terraform module, but has no significance outside of the scope of a module.

* In the *Problems Tool*: Select a finding in the navigation bar to display the issue in detail in the Problems Tool including the type of available fixes.

[#remediation]
==== Remediation

You can mitigate issues directly through both the *Code editor* or the *Problems Tool*. Options include *Fix*, *Suppress*, or *Documentation*. 

NOTE: Not all types of remediation are available for all issues.

==== Fixes

When selecting an issue in either the Code editor and Problems Tool, a suggested fix is displayed when available. Fixes are automatically applied to the code upon selection. The following list displays the type of fix available for the different categories of issues.

* *IaC misconfigurations*: The fix modifies the configuration
* *SCA vulnerabilities*: The fix bumps the package version. You can directly fix the specific CVE vulnerability that has been detected during the scan by upgrading the package to the version that includes a fix 
* *Secrets* issues: Follow the policy guidelines
* *License* mis-compliance: Follow the policy guidelines

==== Suppression

Suppress an issue to temporarily hide or ignore an issue without fixing it, allowing you to concentrate on more important issues. 

NOTE: The suppression is scoped to the file.

. Before you begin, enable *Developer Suppressions* on the Prisma Cloud console.
.. In *Application Security*, select *Settings* > *Application Security* under 'Configure' in the left navbar.
.. Scroll down to *Developer Suppressions* and toggle the switch button *ON*.
. In the IDE, select an issue from the Navigation bar > *Suppress* from either the Code editor or Problems Tool.
. Provide a justification for the suppression> press *Enter* to confirm.
+
NOTE: The justification will be added as a commented annotation to your source code.

After suppressing an issue, the file will not be scanned for two minutes. This is to prevent the issue from being re-triggered. Saving the file during the hold period will not trigger a scan.

For more information on Suppression, refer to the xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/suppress-code-issues.adoc[Suppression] documentation.

==== Documentation

If automated fixes are not available, policy documentation can provide guidance on how to address the issue:
Select an issue > *Documentation*.
You are redirected to the relevant policy documentation which includes suggested guidelines on how to solve the issue.
