== Add Prisma Cloud Application Security Plugin to VS Code IDE

Integrate the Prisma Cloud Code Security plugin (plugin) for VS Code IDE (IDE) to seamlessly enhance security while coding, allowing you to identify issues before you commit your code, reducing the risk of pull requests failing due to undetected issues. Prisma Cloud scans for security policy violations based on both default, out-of-the-box and custom policies.

For default policies, refer to the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/policy-reference/get-started-code-sec-policies/get-started-code-sec-policies[Policies] documentation.

For information on creating custom policies, refer to xref:../../../../governance/custom-build-policies/custom-build-policies.adoc[Custom Build Policies].

The plugin utilizes Prisma Cloud's capabilities to scan these security categories:

* IaC misconfigurations in IaC templates such as Kubernetes and Terraform. For a list of supported IaC frameworks see xref:../../../supported-technologies.adoc[Supported Technologies]
* SCA vulnerabilities: Includes security issues in both direct and transitive open-source dependencies
* Secrets: Security vulnerabilities in your base images
* Licenses: Software license noncompliance

You can prioritize findings and address the most critical issues by filtering the scan results based on severity.

=== Prerequisites

//[.procedure]

. Install https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python] v3.7 or above, https://docs.pipenv.org/[Pipenv], or a running https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker] daemon.
