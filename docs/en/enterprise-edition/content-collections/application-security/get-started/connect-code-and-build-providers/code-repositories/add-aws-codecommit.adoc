== Connect AWS CodeCommit

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your AWS CodeCommit version control system (VCS) to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the AWS CodeCommit platform.
This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, license non-compliance, exposed secrets and CI/CD pipeline risks in your AWS CodeCommit platform, allowing you to contextualize, prioritize and mitigate issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

===  Authorization Process Overview

During integration, Prisma Cloud provides you with a CloudFormation (CFN) template for deploying your AWS account. Once deployed, the CFN template will establish the following components in your environment:

* An IAM role configured with access to AWS CodeCommit
* An Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic with an HTTP subscription to the Prisma Cloud webhook URL

Subsequently, every CloudFormation event occurring in your account, including 'Creation', 'Update' and 'Deletion', will trigger an SNS event. This event will be sent to the Prisma Cloud AWS account.

[.procedure]

. Before you begin.
.. Grant the Prisma Cloud user the necessary permissions for integrating Prisma Cloud with your AWS CodeCommit VCS, as specified in <<#user-permissions, User Permissions>> below.

.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console.

..  Due to CloudFormation's constraints, SNS events for creations, deletions and other actions must reside in the same region as the stack. To accommodate situations where a customer's Prisma Cloud account and stack are in different regions, an SNS topic must be generated for each accessible region.
+
NOTE: In the context of AWS, a 'stack' refers to a collection of AWS resources that are created, updated, and deleted together as a single unit. This allows for the management of related resources as a cohesive unit, making it easier to provision and manage complex infrastructure deployments.

. On the Prisma Cloud console.
.. In *Application Security*, select *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.
+
image::application-security/connect-provider-menu.png[]

.. Select *AWS CodeCommit* (under Code Repositories) in the catalog that is displayed.
+
image::application-security/aws-catalog2.0.png[]
+
The *AWS CodeCommit* integration wizard is displayed, providing instructions to perform the next integration steps in your AWS console.
+
image::application-security/aws-int-wizard-step1-2.0.png[]

. Create a stack on the *AWS* console.

.. Open https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fcas-cf-template-469330042197-prod%2Faws_code_commit_template.json&param_ExternalID=U2FsdGVkX1%2FU4ziNj65RoiKB%2FFDuP1IyMwam8eOuMq9%2FW2NMAzmq%2BI%2B8LTS32A0q[CloudFormation] or copy and send the link to your administrator.
+
A stack template pre-prepared by Prisma Cloud is displayed.

.. Provide the stack name.
+
NOTE: The *Resource Name Prefix* and *ExternalID* fields are pre-populated. You can modify the *Resource Name Prefix*, but *DO NOT* change the *ExternalID*!  

.. Select *Create Stack*.

. Verify successful integration with Prisma Cloud. There are two options.

* Option 1: On Prisma Cloud. Access the wizard: In *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *AWS CodeCommit*.
+
Confirm that the integration is displayed.
+
image::application-security/aws-integration-list2.1.png[]
// this is the current aws-integration-list1.0.png
// NOTE: It may take up to 3 minutes for the integration status to be updated.

* Option 2: On AWS. Open *Cloudformation* > *Stacks*. Verify in the list that that the integration is displayed with a success status.

. Select the repositories to be scanned from the Prisma Cloud console.

.. Navigate to *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *AWS CodeCommit*.

.. Click *Select repositories* in the menu under the integration's *Actions* column.
+
image::application-security/aws-manage-int1.0.png[]
+
The *Add Repositories* step of the integration wizard is displayed. 
+
image::application-security/aws-select-repo1.1.png[]
// this is the current aws-int-wizard-repos1.0.png

.. Select an option: 
+
* *Permit all existing repositories* 
* *Permit all existing and future repositories*.  This is the recommended option to ensure complete coverage and successful operation of all features. 
* *Choose from repository list* > Select repositories


. Select *Done* to complete the integration.

. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
* View your selected AWS CodeCommit repositories on the *Repositories* page. The next AWS CodeCommit scan will include these repositories
* View scan results and resolve issues in the *Projects* page: In *Application Security* select *Home* > *Projects*. See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-and-manage-code-build.adoc[Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues] for more information about mitigating issues

[#multi-integrate]
=== Support for Multiple Integrations

Prisma Cloud supports multiple integrations for multiple AWS CodeCommit accounts. 

Multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account enables you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console
//* Update existing integrations by modifying the selection of workspaces
* Add additional integrations
* Delete an existing integration

NOTE: Selecting a repository for a specific integration will restrict you from selecting the same repository in another integration.

[.procedure]

. In *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *AWS CodeCommit* (under Code Repositories).
. Select *Add Integration* in the wizard.
. Execute the AWS CodeCommit integration process above.
. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results - see *step 7* of the integration process above.


[.task]
=== Manage Integrations

You can reselect repositories or delete an integration.

[.procedure]
. In *Application Security*, select *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers* > *AWS CodeCommit*. 

. Select the menu under the 'Actions' column of the required integration.

. Perform an action:
* *Reselect repositories*: Access and modify the list of repositories to be scanned
* *Delete integration*: Delete an integration

////
* *Manage VCS user tokens*: Enables you to integrate one or more AWS CodeCommit accounts.
+
NOTE: You cannot delete the integration from *Repositories* for an account integration that supports multiple user tokens.
