== Connect Bitbucket

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your Bitbucket version control system (VCS) to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the Bitbucket platform.
This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your Bitbucket environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

The Bitbucket integration creates a webhook that triggers periodic scans of your code. These scans run on all pull requests (PRs), and their results are displayed in both the PR comments and reports.

NOTE: Refer to <<#subscribed-events,Subscribed Events>> below for a list of events to which the integration is subscribed.

[.procedure]

* To view scan results and resolve issues, in *Application Security* select *Home* > *Projects*. See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-and-manage-code-build.adoc[Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues] for more information  


=== Manage integrations

On *Code & Build Providers*, you can also manage the integration by reselection of repositories and deletion of the repository and the integration.

* *Reselect repositories*: Enables you to access the list of repositories for a scan.
* *Delete repository*: Enables you to delete repositories for a scan from the account.
* *Delete entire integration*: Enables you to remove a Bitbucket integration from Prisma Cloud console.

[#user-permissions]
=== User Permissions

Authorize the user integrating Prisma Cloud with your Bitbucket instance with the following permissions.

* *Organization owner* permissions

* *project*: Provides access to view the project or projects. This scope implies the `repository` scope, giving read access to all the repositories in a project or projects. 

* *Administrator repository permissions*: In order to scan pull requests (PRs), the user performing the integration must have administrative privileges for the repositories. This enables Prisma Cloud to set up subscription webhooks for the selected repositories 

* *repository*: Provides read access to a repository or repositories. Note that this scope does not give access to a repository's pull requests. Includes 'access to the repo's source code', 'clone over HTTPS', 'access the file browsing API', 'download zip archives of the repo's contents', 'the ability to view and use the issue tracker on any repo (created issues, comment, vote, etc)', 'the ability to view and use the wiki on any repo (create/edit pages)'

* *repository:write*: Provides write (not admin) access to a repository or repositories. No distinction is made between public and private repositories. This scope implicitly grants the `repository` scope, which does not need to be requested separately. This scope alone does not give access to the pull requests API. Includes 'push access over HTTPS' and 'fork repos'

* *pullrequest*: Provides read access to pull requests. This scope implies the `repository` scope, giving read access to the pull request's destination repository. Includes 'see and list pull requests', 'create and resolve tasks' and 'comment on pull requests'

* *pullrequest:write*: Implicitly grants the `pullrequest` scope and adds the ability to create, merge and decline pull requests. This scope also implicitly grants the `repository:write scope`, giving write access to the pull request's destination repository. This is necessary to allow merging. Includes 'merge pull requests', 'decline pull requests', 'create pull requests' and 'approve pull requests'

* *issue*: The ability to interact with issue trackers the way non-repo members can. This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give implicit access to the repository. Includes 'view, list and search issues', 'create new issues', 'comment on issues', 'watch issues' and 'vote for issues'

* *issue:write*: This scope implicitly grants the issue scope and adds the ability to transition and delete issues. This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give implicit access to the repository. Includes 'transition issues' and 'delete issues'

* *webhook*: Gives access to webhooks. This scope is required for any webhook-related operation.
+
This scope gives read access to existing webhook subscriptions on all resources the authorization mechanism can access, without needing further scopes. For example:
+
A client can list all existing webhook subscriptions on a repository. The repository scope is not required.
Existing webhook subscriptions for the issue tracker on a repo can be retrieved without the issue scope. All that is required is the webhook scope.
+
To create webhooks, the client will need read access to the resource. Such as: for `issue:created`, the client will need to have both the webhook and the issue scope. Includes 'list webhook subscriptions on any accessible repository, user, team, or snippet' and 'create/update/delete webhook subscriptions'

* *snippet*: Provides read access to snippets. No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public snippets are accessible without any form of authentication). Includes 'view any snippet' and 'create snippet comments'

* *email*: Ability to see the user's primary email address. This should make it easier to use Bitbucket Cloud as a login provider for apps or external applications

* *account*: When used for:
+
** *user-related APIs*: Gives read-only access to the user's account information. Note that this doesn't include any ability to change any of the data. This scope allows you to view the user's: email addresses,language, location, website, full name, SSH keys, user groups
+
** *workspace-related APIs*: Grants access to view the workspace's: users, user permissions, projects

* *pipeline*: Gives read-only access to pipelines, steps, deployment environments and variables

* *pipeline:write*: Gives write access to pipelines. This scope allows a user to: stop pipelines, rerun failed pipelines, resume halted pipelines and trigger manual pipelines
