== Connect GitLab Self-Managed  

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your GitLab Self-managed version control system (VCS) to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the GitLab self-managed platform.

This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your GitLab environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

The GitLab Self-managed integration creates a webhook that triggers periodic scans of your code. These scans run on all pull requests (PRs), and their results are displayed in both the PR comments and reports.

NOTE: Refer to <<#subscribed-events,Subscribed Events>> below for a list of subscribed events for which the integration is subscribed to. 

[.procedure]

. Before you begin.
.. Grant the Prisma Cloud user the necessary permissions for integrating Prisma Cloud with your GitLab Self-managed VCS, as specified in <<#user-permissions, User Permissions>> below.

.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console. 
.. Ensure the use of the default port 443 for the integration.

. On the Prisma Cloud Application Security console.

.. In *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.
+

+
The *Configure Domain* step of the integration wizard (wizard) is displayed.

.. Enter your domain or IP address in the *Configure Domain* step of the installation wizard> *Register*.
+
NOTE: The domain is the hostname associated with your self-hosted GitLab instance.
+
The *Register OAUTH app* step of the wizard is displayed.
+

.. Copy the values *Application Name* and *Redirect URL* fields > *Next*.
+
You are redirected to your GitLab Self-managed instance.

. On the GitLab Self-managed console.

.. Create an application.
+
* Access *GitLab Self-Managed > User Settings > Applications*.
* Paste the copied *Application Name* and *Redirect URL* in their respective fields.
.. Select *api* as the application scope > *Save application*.
.. Copy the generated *Application ID* and *Secret* values that are displayed after the application is created.
+

. In the *Set Client ID and Secret* step of the Prisma Cloud integration wizard.

.. Paste the generated *Application ID* and *Secret* values that you copied above > click  *Authorize*.
+
The *Select Repositories* step of the wizard is displayed.

. Select which repositories will be scanned. 
+
* *Permit all existing repositories* 
* *Permit all existing and future repositories*.  This is the recommended option to ensure complete coverage and successful operation of all features 
* *Choose from repository list* > Select repositories

. Select *Next* > *Done* in the *Status* step of the wizard to complete the integration.

. Verify integration.
.. In *Application Security*, select *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers*.
.. Confirm that the status of the integrated *GitLab* repositories displays *Connected* under *Status*.
+
NOTE: It may take up to 3 minutes for the integration status to be updated.

. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
* View your selected GitLab Self-managed repositories on the *Repositories* page. The next GitLab Self-managed scan will include these repositories
* To view scan results and resolve issues, in *Application Security* select *Home* > *Projects*. See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-and-manage-code-build.adoc[Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues] for more information

[#multi-integrate]
=== Support for Multiple Integrations

Prisma Cloud supports multiple integrations for GitLab Self-Managed. After the initial integration with Prisma Cloud, you can continue to add additional organizations and workspaces using a different or the same user or team token.

Multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account enables you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console
* Add additional integrations
* Delete an existing integration

NOTE: Selecting a repository for a specific integration will restrict you from selecting the same repository in another integration.

[.procedure]

. Add additional integrations to a configured GitLab Self-Managed account.
. In Application Security, select *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *GitLab Self-managed* (under Code Repositories).
.. Select *Add Integration* in the wizard.
.. Execute the installation steps above.
. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results - see _step 6_ of the integration procedure above.

//The *Configure Domain* step of the installation wizard is displayed.
//image::application-security/gl-sm-add-integration.png[]
////
.. Configure your Domain as stated in step *1* of the GitLab Self-Managed installation process above and then proceed to execute steps *2-6* of the installation procedure.
////

////
+
Your selected GitLab repositories will be visible on the *Repositories* page. The next GitLab scan will include the selected repositories. 

To view scan results and resolve issues, select *Application Security* > *Projects*. See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-code-build-issues.adoc[here] for more information.  
////

// verify if Code Security has not been changed

[.task]
=== Manage Integrations

Manage integrations from the integration wizard.

[.procedure]

. Access the GitLab Self-Managed integration wizard - see *step 1* of <<multi-integrate,Support for Multiple Integrations>> above.

. Select the menu under *Actions*.

.. Select *Reselect repositories* to add or remove repositories
.. Select  *Delete Integration* to delete integrations

// To check if deleting a single integration within the account deletes the account configuration on Prisma Cloud console.

[#user-permissions]
=== User Permissions

Authorize the user integrating Prisma Cloud with your GitLab Self-managed instance with the following permissions.

* *api*: Grants full *read* and *write* access to the API, including all groups and projects, as well as permissions to interact with the container registry, the dependency proxy, and the package registry

NOTE: A repository can only be integrated with a single integration at a time. The first integration that connects with the repository will be the one it is assigned to. This means that if multiple integrations attempt to connect to the same repository, only the first integration to establish the connection will be associated with that repository.
