== Connect Bitbucket Data Center/Bitbucket Server  

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your Bitbucket Data Center or Bitbucket Server version control systems (VCS) to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up your Bitbucket Data Center/Bitbucket Server platforms.

This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your Bitbucket environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

The integration with Bitbucket Data Center/Bitbucket Server creates a webhook that triggers periodic scans of your code. These scans run on all pull requests (PRs), and their results are displayed in both the PR comments and reports.

NOTE: Refer to <<#subscribed-events,Subscribed Events>> below for a list of events to which the integration is subscribed.

=== Supported Versions

* Integrating with Bitbucket Data Center or Bitbucket Server extends support for Bitbucket Data Center and Data Center Server versions 6.7 and later

* The CI/CD Security module is compatible with Bitbucket Data Center and Bitbucket Server versions 8 and later

=== Prerequisites

. Grant the Prisma Cloud user the necessary permissions for integrating Prisma Cloud with your Bitbucket Data Center or Bitbucket Server, as specified in <<#user-permissions, User Permissions>> below.

. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console. 

. Ensure that the provided hostname or IP address is resolvable on public DNS servers.
. Ensure the use of the default port 443 for the integration.

. On *Bitbucket Server*, create and copy a *Personal Access Token* (PAT).
.. Access *Bitbucket Server* > *Manage account* > *Account settings* > *Personal access tokens*.
.. Provide a *Token name*.
.. Select the *Permissions* scope.
+
* For Projects: *Read* permissions. If you require for CI/CD scanning capabilities, select *Administrator* permissions
* For Repositories: *Administrator* permissions
+
Providing read and write permissions to the necessary repositories enables Prisma Cloud to copy files for scanning, and access repository settings. This, in turn, facilitates the ability to subscribe to pull request (PR) webhooks, allowing for the initiation of fix PRs and comments on open PRs.
+
NOTE: By default,the permissions of the access token are set according to your current access level. It is essential to define two levels of permissions, *Project* and *Repository* permissions. The Repository permissions inherit from Project permissions, requiring Repository permissions to match or exceed Project permissions.

.. Select the *Expire automatically* option.
+
NOTE: For additional security, it is recommended to set an expiry automatically. The expiry date of a token cannot be changed after it is created. You can see the expiry dates for all your tokens on *Profile picture* > *Manage account* > *Personal access tokens*.

.. Select *Create*.
.. Copy the generated token from the dialog.
+
NOTE: Always refer to the https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver072/personal-access-tokens-1005335924.html[Bitbucket] documentation for information relating to creating a PAT.

+
The *Select Repositories* step of the wizard is displayed.
+
image::application-security/bb-server-datacenter-wiz-repos2.0.png[]


. Select which repositories will be scanned. 
+
* *Permit all existing repositories* 
* *Permit all existing and future repositories*.  This is the recommended option to ensure complete coverage and successful operation of all features 
* *Choose from repository list* > Select repositories
The selected repositories associated with the PAT will be scanned

. Select *Next* > *Done* in the *Status* step of the wizard to complete the integration.

. Verify integration.
.. In *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers* tab.
.. Confirm that the status of the integrated *Bitbucket Server/ Data Center* repositories displays *Connected* under *Status*.
+
NOTE: It may take up to 3 minutes for the integration status to be updated.

. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
To view scan results and resolve issues, in *Application Security* select *Home* > *Projects*. See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-and-manage-code-build.adoc[Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues] for more information.

[#multi-integrate]
=== Support for Multiple Integrations

Prisma Cloud supports multiple integrations with Bitbucket Data Center/Server instances. Once you've initially integrated with Prisma Cloud, you can add more integrations using either the existing user or team token, if the current server has additional repositories requiring integration. Integrating with a new domain or server, such as a different Bitbucket Data Center/Server instance, will require a new integration process and token.

Leveraging multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account allows you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console
* Add additional integrations
* Delete an existing integration

NOTE: Selecting a repository for a specific integration will restrict you from selecting the same repository for another integration.

[.procedure]

. In *Application Security*, select *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *Bitbucket Server/Data Center* (under Code Repositories) in the catalog that is displayed.  
+
A popup with a list of Bitbucket Data Center/Server integrations is displayed.
+
image::application-security/bb-server-multi-int1.1.png[]

. Select *Add Integration*.
+
The Configure Domain step of the integration wizard is displayed.
. Execute the <<#integration,Integration>> steps above, starting from step 1.3.
. Next step: See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-and-manage-code-build.adoc[Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues].


[.task]
=== Manage Integrations

Manage integrations from the integration wizard.

[.procedure]

. Access the list of Bitbucket Data Center/ Server integrations - see *steps 1,2* of <<#multi-integrate,Support for Multiple Integrations>> above.
. Choose the corresponding option from the menu located under the *Actions* column.

.. Select *Reselect repositories* to add or remove repositories
.. Select *Delete Integration* to delete integrations

=== Rotate Integration Tokens

Rotate integration tokens to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

Create a *PUT* request: `PUT /code/api/v1/integration/token/<integration_id>` with the following body:

[source,JSON]
----
{
"token": "new token"
}
----

To find your <integration_id>: 

. In *Application Security*, select *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *Bitbucket Server/Data Center* (under Code Repositories) in the catalog that is displayed.  
. Select the menu under the *Actions* column of an account.
. Click *Reselect repositories*.
+
The integration ID is displayed in the URL bar on the *Select Repositories* step of the integration wizard.
