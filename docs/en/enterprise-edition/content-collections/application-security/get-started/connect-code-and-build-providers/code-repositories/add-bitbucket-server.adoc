== Connect Bitbucket Data Center/Bitbucket Server  

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your Bitbucket Data Center or Bitbucket Server version control systems (VCS) to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up your Bitbucket Data Center/Bitbucket Server platforms.

This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your Bitbucket environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

NOTE: Integrating with Bitbucket Data Center or Bitbucket Server extends support for Bitbucket Data Center and Data Center Server versions 6.7 and later.

The integration with Bitbucket Data Center/Bitbucket Server creates a webhook that triggers periodic scans of your code. These scans run on all pull requests (PRs), and their results are displayed in both the PR comments and reports.

NOTE: Refer to <<#subscribed-events,Subscribed Events>> below for a list of events to which the integration is subscribed.

=== Prerequisites

. Grant the Prisma Cloud user the necessary permissions for integrating Prisma Cloud with your Bitbucket Data Center or Bitbucket Server, as specified in <<#user-permissions, User Permissions>> below.

. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console. 

. Ensure that the provided hostname or IP address is resolvable on public DNS servers.
. Ensure the use of the default port 443 for the integration.

. On *Bitbucket Server*, create and copy a *Personal Access Token* (PAT).
.. Access *Bitbucket Server* > *Manage account* > *Account settings* > *Personal access tokens*.
.. Provide a *Token name*.
.. Select the *Permissions* scope.
+
* For Projects: *Read* permissions
* For Repositories: *Administrator* permissions
+
Providing read and write permissions to the necessary repositories enables Prisma Cloud to copy files for scanning, and access repository settings. This, in turn, facilitates the ability to subscribe to pull request (PR) webhooks, allowing for the initiation of fix PRs and comments on open PRs.
+
NOTE: By default,the permissions of the access token are set according to your current access level. It is essential to define two levels of permissions, *Project* and *Repository* permissions. The Repository permissions inherit from Project permissions, requiring Repository permissions to match or exceed Project permissions.

.. Select the *Expire automatically* option.
+
NOTE: For additional security, it is recommended to set an expiry automatically. The expiry date of a token cannot be changed after it is created. You can see the expiry dates for all your tokens on *Profile picture* > *Manage account* > *Personal access tokens*.

.. Select *Create*.
.. Copy the generated token from the dialog.
+
NOTE: See the https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver072/personal-access-tokens-1005335924.html[Bitbucket] documentation on how to create a PAT.

+
The *Select Repositories* step of the wizard is displayed.
+

. Select which repositories will be scanned. 
+
* *Permit all existing repositories* 
* *Permit all existing and future repositories*.  This is the recommended option to ensure complete coverage and successful operation of all features 
* *Choose from repository list* > Select repositories
The selected repositories associated with the PAT will be scanned

. Select *Next* > *Done* in the *Status* step of the wizard to complete the integration.

. Verify integration.
.. In *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers* tab.
.. Confirm that the status of the integrated *Bitbucket Server/ Data Center* repositories displays *Connected* under *Status*.
+
NOTE: It may take up to 3 minutes for the integration status to be updated.

. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
To view scan results and resolve issues, in *Application Security* select *Home* > *Projects*. See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-and-manage-code-build.adoc[Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues] for more information.

[#multi-integrate]
=== Support for Multiple Integrations

Prisma Cloud offers supports for multiple integrations with Bitbucket Data Center/Server instances. After the initial integration with Prisma Cloud, you can add additional instances using either the same user or team token, or by generating a dedicated token. Multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account enable you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console
* Add additional integrations
* Delete an existing integration

NOTE: Selecting a repository for a specific integration will restrict you from selecting the same repository for another integration.

[.procedure]

. Add additional integrations to a configured Bitbucket Data Center/Server account.
. In Application Security, select *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *Bitbucket Server/Data Center* (under Code Repositories).
+
image:application-security/bb-server-multi-int1.1.png[]

.. Select *Add Integration* in the wizard.
.. Execute the <<#installation,Installation>> steps above.
. Next step: See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-and-manage-code-build.adoc[Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues].
