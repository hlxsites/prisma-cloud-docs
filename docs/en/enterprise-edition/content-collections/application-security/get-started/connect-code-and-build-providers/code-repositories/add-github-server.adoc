== Connect GitHub Server 

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your GitHub Server version control system to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the GitHub Server platform.

This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your GitHub Server environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

The GitHub Server integration creates a webhook that triggers periodic scans of your code. These scans run on all pull requests (PRs), and their results are displayed in both the PR comments and reports.

NOTE: Refer to <<#subscribed-events,Subscribed Events>> below for a list of events to which the integration is subscribed.

[#user-permissions]
=== User Permissions

Authorize the user integrating Prisma Cloud with your GitHub Server instance with the following permissions.

* *repo*: Grants full access to public and private repositories, including read and write access to code, commit statuses, repository invitations, collaborators, deployment statuses, and repository webhooks
+
NOTE: In addition to repository-related resources, the repository scope also grants access to manage organization-owned resources, including projects, invitations, team memberships, and webhooks. This scope also grants the ability to manage projects owned by users

* *read:user*: Grants access to read a user's profile data

* *read:repo_hook*: Grants read and ping access to hooks in public or private repositories

* *read:org*: Provides read-only access to organization membership, organization projects, and team membership

* *read:public_key*: Allows listing and viewing details for public keys

* *workflow*: Provides the ability to add and update GitHub Actions workflow files. Workflow files can be committed without this scope if the same file (with both the same path and contents) exists on another branch in the same repository. Workflow files can expose GITHUB_TOKEN, which may have a different set of scopes. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token[Automatic token authentication]

* *admin:org_hook*: Grants read, write, ping, and delete access to organization hooks. Note: OAuth tokens will only be able to perform these actions on organization hooks created by the OAuth app. Personal access tokens will only be able to perform these actions on organization hooks created by a user
