== Connect GitHub Server 

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your GitHub Server version control system (VCS) to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the GitHub Server platform.

This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your GitHub Server environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

The GitHub Server integration creates a webhook that triggers periodic scans of your code. These scans run on all pull requests (PRs), and their results are displayed in both the PR comments and reports.

NOTE: Refer to <<#subscribed-events,Subscribed Events>> below for a list of events to which the integration is subscribed.

[.procedure]
. Before you begin.
.. Grant the Prisma Cloud user the necessary permissions for integrating Prisma Cloud with your GitHub Server VCS, as specified in <<#user-permissions, User Permissions>> below.
.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console. 
.. Ensure that the provided hostname or IP address is resolvable on public DNS servers.
.. Ensure the use of the default port 443 for the integration.

. On the Prisma Cloud Application Security console.
.. In Application Security, select *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.

+
image::application-security/github-server-select-repo.png[]

.. Select which repositories will be scanned. 
+
* *Permit all existing repositories* 
* *Permit all existing and future repositories*.  This is the recommended option to ensure complete coverage and successful operation of all features. 
* *Choose from repository list* > Select repositories

.. Select *Next*.
The *New account successfully configured* message appears after you have successfully set up the configurations.
.. Select *Done* in the *Status* step of the wizard to complete the integration.

. Verify integration.
.. In *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers*.
.. Confirm that the status of the integrated *GitHub* repositories displays *Connected* under *Status*.
+
NOTE: It may take up to 3 minutes for the integration status to be updated.

. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
* View your selected GitHub Server repositories on the *Repositories* page. The next GitHub Server scan will include these repositories
* To view scan results and resolve issues, in *Application Security* select *Home* > *Projects*. See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-and-manage-code-build.adoc[Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues] for more information 

[#user-permissions]
=== User Permissions

Authorize the user integrating Prisma Cloud with your GitHub Server instance with the following permissions.

* *Organization owner* permissions

* *Administrator repository permissions*: In order to scan pull requests (PRs), the user performing the integration must have administrative privileges for the repositories. This enables Prisma Cloud to set up subscription webhooks for the selected repositories 

* *repo*: Grants full access to public and private repositories, including read and write access to code, commit statuses, repository invitations, collaborators, deployment statuses, and the capability to subscribe the repository to receive new webhook notifications or events
+
NOTE: In addition to repository-related resources, the repository scope also grants access to manage organization-owned resources, including projects, invitations, team memberships, and webhooks. This scope also grants the ability to manage projects owned by users

* *read:user*: Grants access to read a user's profile data

* *read:repo_hook*: Grants read and ping access to hooks in public or private repositories

* *read:org*: Provides read-only access to organization membership, organization projects, and team membership

* *read:public_key*: Allows listing and viewing details for public keys

* *workflow*: Provides the ability to add and update GitHub Actions workflow files. Workflow files can be committed without this scope if the same file (with both the same path and contents) exists on another branch in the same repository. Workflow files can expose GITHUB_TOKEN, which may have a different set of scopes. For more information, see the GitHub Actions https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token[Automatic token authentication] documentation.

* *admin:org_hook*: Grants read, write, ping, and delete access to organization hooks. Note: OAuth tokens will only be able to perform these actions on organization hooks created by the OAuth app. Personal access tokens will only be able to perform these actions on organization hooks created by a user
