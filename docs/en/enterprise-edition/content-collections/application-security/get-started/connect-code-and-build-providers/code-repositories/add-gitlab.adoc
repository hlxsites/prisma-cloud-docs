== Connect GitLab  

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your GitLab version control system (VCS) to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the GitLab platform.

This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your GitLab environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

The GitLab integration creates a webhook that triggers periodic scans of your code. These scans run on all pull requests (PRs), and their results are displayed in both the PR comments and reports.

NOTE: Refer to <<#subscribed-events,Subscribed Events>> below for a list of subscribed events for which the integration is subscribed to. 

[.procedure]

. Before you begin.
.. Grant the Prisma Cloud user the necessary permissions for integrating Prisma Cloud with your GitLab VCS, as specified in <<#user-permissions, User Permissions>> below.

.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console. 

. On the Prisma Cloud Application Security console.
.. In Application Security, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.

.. Select *Authorize* in the *Configure Account* step of the integration wizard that is displayed.
+
You are redirected to GitLab to authorize Prisma Cloud access.

. On GitLab, review the requested permissions > *Authorize*.
+
You are redirected to the *Select Repositories* step of the installation wizard on the Prisma Cloud console.
+
image::application-security/gitlab-select-repos.png[]

. Select which repositories will be scanned:
+
* *Permit all existing repositories*
* *Permit all existing and future repositories*
+
NOTE: This is the recommended option to ensure complete coverage and successful operation of all features.
* *Choose from repository list*  > select repositories

. Select *Next* > *Done* in the *Status* step of the wizard to complete the integration.

. Verify integration.
.. In *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers*.
.. Confirm that the status of the integrated *GitLab* repositories displays *Connected* under *Status*.
+
NOTE: It may take up to 3 minutes for the integration status to be updated.

. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
* View your selected GitLab repositories on the *Repositories* page. The next GitLab scan will include these repositories
* To view scan results and resolve issues, in *Application Security* select *Home* > *Projects*. See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-and-manage-code-build.adoc[Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues] for more information

[#multi-integrate]
=== Support for Multiple Integrations

Prisma Cloud supports multiple integrations for GitLab. After the initial integration with Prisma Cloud, you can continue to add additional organizations and workspaces using a different or a same user or team token.

Multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account enables you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console
//* Update existing integrations by modifying the selection of workspaces
* Add additional integrations
* Delete an existing integration

NOTE: Selecting a repository for a specific integration will restrict you from selecting the same repository in another integration.

[.procedure]

. In Application Security, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *GitLab* (under Code Repositories).
. Select *Add Integration* in the wizard.
. Execute the GitLab installation process above.
. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results - see above.

[.task]
=== Manage Integrations

Manage integrations from the integration wizard.
[.procedure]
. Access the GitLab integration wizard on Prisma Cloud console - see the integration process above > select the menu under *Actions*.

. From _Actions_ you can: 
+
* Add or remove repositories from *Reselect repositories*

* Delete integrations


// To check if deleting a single integration within the account deletes the account configuration on Prisma Cloud console.

[#user-permissions]
=== User Permissions

Authorize the user integrating Prisma Cloud with your GitLab instance with the following permissions.

* *Organization owner* permissions

* *api*: Grants full *read* and *write* access to the API, including all groups and projects, as well as permissions to interact with the container registry, the dependency proxy, and the package registry

* *Administrator repository permissions*: In order to scan pull requests (PRs), the user performing the integration must have administrative privileges for the repositories. This enables Prisma Cloud to set up subscription webhooks for the selected repositories 

NOTE: A repository can only be integrated with a single integration at a time. The first integration that connects with the repository will be the one it is assigned to. This means that if multiple integrations attempt to connect to the same repository, only the first integration to establish the connection will be associated with that repository.
