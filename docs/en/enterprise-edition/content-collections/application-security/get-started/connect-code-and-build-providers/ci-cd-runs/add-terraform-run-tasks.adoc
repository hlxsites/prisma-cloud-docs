== Connect Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks)

Integrate Prisma Cloud with Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks) to allow dynamic, automated, and context-specific scans in your Terraform workspace.

With the integration of Terraform Cloud, Prisma Cloud, scans your Terraform frameworks to identify misconfigurations based on Prisma Cloud's default policies, as well as custom policies created by your organization for specific needs. This scanning process occurs whenever changes are pushed or triggered in your workflow, ensuring security checks are integrated seamlessly. Prisma Cloud identifies issues such as misconfigurations in your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files, software composition analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities^*^, exposed secrets, and license non-compliance as soon as they are introduced. 
^*^Prisma Cloud performs Image Referencer scans for identifying vulnerabilities, as full SCA scans are not supported for Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks).

Each identified issue can either be resolved or suppressed on the Prisma Cloud console. Additionally, Prisma Cloud offers automated shift-left actions such as notifying developers or creating tickets, based on scan results.

Integrating Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks) with Prisma Cloud is performed at the workspace level. This means that you need to set up the integration between Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks) with Prisma Cloud for each workspace that you intend to scan.

NOTE: The following integration includes workflows involving third party tools such as Terraform and GitHub. These are general guidelines only, intended to help you. You must always follow the official third party documentation.

[.procedure]

. Before you begin:
+
* Procure a license for Prisma Cloud with the Application Security module enabled* 
* Procure a https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing[Terraform cloud license] that is either a trial license or a TF Cloud license at the TEAM & GOVERNANCE level  
* Create a Terraform 'Organization' and 'Workspace'- see xref:add-terraform-cloud-sentinel.adoc[Terraform Cloud (Sentinel)] for more on creating organizations and workspaces
* *Permissions*: Grant the user or team the following permissions: *Manage Workspaces* permissions at the organization level or *Administrator* permissions on the workspace(s) being integrated.


=== On Terraform Cloud

. Create a Terraform *api token* for your user.
+
* Select your user/profile icon > *User Settings*.
* Select the *Tokens* section from the left side menu.
* Click *Create an API token* and provide a description > Select *Create API token*. 
* Copy and save the token > *Done*. 
+
NOTE: Skip this step if you plan on using an existing token. 

=== On Prisma Cloud console

.. In Application Security, select *Settings > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks)* (under CI/CD Runs).
+
The *Configure Account* step of the integration wizard opens.

. Provide your User or Team token > *Next*>.
+
The *Select Organization* step of the integration wizard is displayed.

. In the *Select Organization* step of the wizard, select a Terraform organization > *Next*.
. In the *Select Workspace* step of the wizard: 
.. Select a workspace from the Terraform field menu.
+
NOTE: You can select multiple workspaces for Prisma Cloud to scan during the Terraform Cloud run lifecycle. Each integration can only be associated with a single Terraform Cloud organization at any given time. However, you can create multiple integrations with multiple Terraform Enterprise organizations from a single Prisma Cloud account.

.. In *Run Stage*, select an option.
+
* *Post-plan*: The scan runs after Terraform generates the plan
* *Pre-plan*: The scan runs before Terraform generates the plan
+
NOTE: Prisma Cloud performs a scan of Terraform templates on selected workspaces based on the RUN Stage.

.. Select *Next* > *Done*.
+
NOTE: An event hook is created in the Terraform organization to receive run task notification on Prisma Cloud. 

. Verify integration: Select *Settings* > *CI/CD Runs* tab.
+
Your integrated Terraform repositories will be displayed. 

. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
The next Terraform scan will automatically include the selected repositories. 

To view scan results and resolve issues, select *Application Security* > *Projects* > *CI/CD Runs* tab. See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-code-build-issues.adoc[here] for more information.

=== Support for multiple integrations

Prisma Cloud supports multiple integrations for a Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks). After the initial integration with Prisma Cloud, you can continue to add additional organizations and workspaces using a different or the same user or team token.
Multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account enables you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console.
* Update existing integrations by modifying the selection of workspaces.
* Add additional integrations using user or team tokens.
* Delete an existing integration.

[.procedure]

. Add additional integrations to a configured Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks).

.. In Application Security, select *Settings > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks)* (under CI/CD Runs).

.. Select *Add an account*.
.. Repeat the integration process above.

=== Manage Integrations

. .. Access *Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks)* (under CI/CD Runs) - see above.

. Select *Actions* for an integration.

* *Reselect Workspaces*: You can add or remove existing workspaces from your integrated Terraform Cloud account.
* *Delete integration*: This removes an integration from the Terraform Cloud account on Prisma Cloud console.
