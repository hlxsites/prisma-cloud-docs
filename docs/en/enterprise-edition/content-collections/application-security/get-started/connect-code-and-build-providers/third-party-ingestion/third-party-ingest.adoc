== Third Party Ingestion

Prisma Cloud ingests findings directly from third-party sources, allowing you to leverage its analysis and visualization tools to detect critical vulnerabilities, prioritize remediation, and enhance application security. Findings from third parties are processed according to the platform's existing Finding/Issue lifecycle, with platform policies determining their escalation to Issues when required. This integration delivers a unified and comprehensive security overview by consolidating data from multiple sources into a single-pane-of-glass view.
