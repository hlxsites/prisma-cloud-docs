== Transporter Health Check

The health check provides about the VCS integrations and the most recent connection establishment time. The Transporter runs health checks every hour, and you manually refresh the connection at any time through Prisma Cloud.

Prisma Cloud scans every Transporter configuration for a secure connection. After authenticating the secure connection, you will be able to view the health check of the Transporter.

==== Health Check Types
Prisma cloud supports three types of client health checks: 'Transporter Client at VCS Domain', 'Transporter Client at Prisma Cloud Server' and 'Transporter Client in client environment and Transporter Client at Prisma Cloud environment'.

==== Transporter Client at VCS Domain

`Route - /internalcheck`

Checks if there is a connection with your VCS machine using Transporter.

Apply additional headers to a `CURL` command in order to point to the VCS that the check should be applied to:

* `x-forwarded-host`: The VCS machine hostname for the check

* `x-forwarded-path`: The path of the request to send to the VCS machine

* `x-forwarded-proto`: The protocol which to check connectivity on - https or http

=== Transporter Client at Prisma Cloud Server

`Route - /externalcheck`

Checks if there is internet access to Prisma server from the machine. Uses `/login` route with `accessKey` and `secretKey`.

==== Transporter Client in Client Environment and Transporter Client at Prisma Cloud Environment

`Route - /selfcheck`

Checks if the certificates provided are valid for the domain of the machine and runs on request over HTTPS.

`/healthz`, is used for docker `healthcheck` on the internal port of docker `8080`.

NOTE: You must run at least three test checks before running the Docker image. Response values: `ok:true` for passed checks, `ok:false` for failed checks.

[#self-signed-certificates]
=== Self Signed Certificates
Ensure the security of your Transporter Client when using self-signed certificates, by adding SSL/TLS CA Certificate environment variables, and configuring the HTTPS_CA variable.
