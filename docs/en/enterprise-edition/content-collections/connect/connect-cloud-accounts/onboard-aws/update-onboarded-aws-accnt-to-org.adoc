== Update an Onboarded AWS Account to AWS Organization

If you had previously onboarded an individual AWS account as type *Account* and now you want to onboard the same account as type *Organization*, you can do so without losing any changes to the onboarded account and assigned account groups.

[.procedure]
. On *Settings > Providers > Cloud Accounts*, identify the account which you want to update from *Account* to *Organization* type.

. Select *Connect Provider > Cloud Account*.

. Select *AWS*

. Select *Organization*.

. Enter an *Account Name*.
+
You can enter the same *Account Name* as the one you had entered while onboarding as account or enter a different name.

. Select the *Security Capabilities and Permissions* that you want to enable. 

. Click *Next*.

. While configuring the account, if you want to retain the existing role name and external ID for a member account when you move that account from standalone to under an organization, select the *Preserve Role ARN and External ID of already onboarded accounts that belong to this Org* checkbox under *Advanced Settings*.
+
In the future, if you want to update the member CFT for which the role name and external ID was retained when it is moved from standalone to under an organization, you have to download CFT using download CFT API and update the corresponding stack in your AWS console.
+
* The role name and download CFT for these members is not available in the UI.
* You need to save these values or you can contact Prima Cloud customer support.
* You will not be able to change these member role names unless you deselect the *Preserve Role ARN and External ID of already onboarded accounts that belong to this Org* checkbox.

. *Download IAM Role CFT* and complete the required *Steps*.

. Select *All* member accounts.

. Make sure you assign the same *Account Group* that you had assigned when you had onboarded as an account.

. Click *Next*.

. *Review Status* of your AWS organization.

. Click *Save*.
+
After successfully onboarding the account, you will see it onboarded as an *Organization* on the *Cloud Accounts* page.

//[NOTE]
//====
//Updating from an individual account to an *Organization* is not supported for *Agentless* functions. If you previously onboarded a single account and now wish to switch to an *Organization* you will need to delete the single account on Prisma Cloud before proceeding with creating an *Organization*.
