== Onboard Your Google Workspace

Connect your Google Workspace account to Prisma Cloud to monitor your users, groups, and group memberships.

If you use Workspace as an IdP for user and group management and want visibility and security of those accounts, onboard the Workspace accounts to Prisma Cloud. After onboarding, you can configure alert rules for Workspace related custom policies. 

You need to complete steps on your Workspace console and the Prisma Cloud console.

Before you begin, make sure to enable the `admin.googleapis.com` service in your Google Cloud project.
