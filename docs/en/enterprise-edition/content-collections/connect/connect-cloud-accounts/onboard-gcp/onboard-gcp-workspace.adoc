== Onboard Your Google Workspace

Connect your Google Workspace account to Prisma Cloud to monitor your users, groups, group memberships.

If you use Workspace as an IdP for your user and group management and you want visibility and security of those accounts, onboard the Workspace accounts to Prisma Cloud. After completing onboarding, you can configure alert rules on Workspace related MFA policies (identifying Workspace users that have MFA enabled or disabled).

You need to complete steps on your Workspace console and the Prisma Cloud console.
