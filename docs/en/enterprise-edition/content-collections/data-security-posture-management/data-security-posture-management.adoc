== Data Security Posture Management

Prisma Cloud Data Security Posture Management (DSPM), previously known as the Dig Security platform, helps you discover, classify, protect, and govern your data across multi-cloud environments. With Prisma Cloud DSPM, you can reduce data misuse, achieve compliance, and prevent ransomware attacks and data breaches.

Prisma Cloud DSPM metering depends on the type of data assets being secured.

* For IaaS and PaaS assets, DSPM requires 1 credit per data asset.
* For DBaaS assets, DSPM requires 1 credit per TB of data volume (i.e. size of the data asset).
* For SaaS assets, DSPM requires 0.1 credit per user in supported SaaS applications.
