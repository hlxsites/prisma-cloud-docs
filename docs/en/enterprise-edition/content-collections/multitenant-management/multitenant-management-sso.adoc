== Configure SSO for User Onboarding

Prisma Cloud offers System Administrators the ability to provision users using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) based Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration. Configure SSO to create new Prisma Cloud Multitenant Management users on an as needed basis, when users with the appropriate entitlements log in using SSO. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Once SSO configuration is set up, users must use the SP initiated Auth URL (*Home > Settings > SSO > SP Auth URL*) to login for the first time. Other SAML based IdP initiated login workflows are *not* supported.
