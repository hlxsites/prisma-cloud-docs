== Configure SSO for User Onboarding

Prisma Cloud offers System Administrators the ability to provision users using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) based Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration. Configure SSO to create new Prisma Cloud Multitenant Management users on an as needed basis, when users with the appropriate entitlements log in using SSO. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Once SSO configuration is set up, users must use the SP initiated Auth URL (*Home > Settings > SSO > SP Auth URL*) to login for the first time. 
* User onboarding is currently only available using SAML based SSO configuration.

Complete the steps below on the Multitenant Management console and your IdP to set up SSO provisioning:

[.procedure]

. Select *Logout Config > Enabled* if you wish to log users out of your IdP provider, when they log out of the Multinenant Management console.

* SP Auth URL - Share this URL with organization members to begin the SSO process (SP Init).
* Audience URL - Audience data as required by the IdP SAML config.
