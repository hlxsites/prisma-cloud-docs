== Configure SSO for User Onboarding

Prisma Cloud offers System Administrators the ability to provision users using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) based Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration. Configure SSO to create new Prisma Cloud Multitenant Management users on an as needed basis, when users with the appropriate entitlements log in using SSO. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Once SSO configuration is set up, users must use the SP initiated Auth URL (*Home > Settings > SSO > SP Auth URL*) to login for the first time. 
* User onboarding is currently only available using SAML based SSO configuration.

=== SSO Configuration for Microsoft Entra 

Follow the steps below to configure Microsoft Entra IdP for SSO Access to the Multitenancy console. Microsoft Entra is third-party software, specific procedures, and screenshots may change without notice. We encourage you to also review the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/[Microsoft Entra documentation]. 

The topic outlines steps to create an Enterprise Application in Microsoft Entra, configure SAML properties, add users and groups, and set up SAML attributes. It also details configuring SSO settings in the Prisma Cloud Multitenant Management Console, including entering metadata URLs and additional parameters. Finally, it describes testing the SSO login process.

[.procedure]
. Complete the following steps on the Microsoft Azure Entra portal to create an Enterprise Application and configure SAML properties. 

.. Create and configure a new *Enterprise Application* in Microsoft Entra.
