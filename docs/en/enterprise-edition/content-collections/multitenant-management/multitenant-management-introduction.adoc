== Prisma Cloud Multitenant Management Overview


Effectively deliver security at scale with Prisma Cloud's Multitenant Management service. Multitenant Management offers a rich set of features including a centralized dashboard for the efficient management of a large number of tenants. Tenants managed by the Multitenant Management console are called managed Prisma Cloud tenants.

With the Multitenant Management console you can streamline the following functions: 

* Manage and operate a large number of tenants from a single console.
* Dynamically create and delete tenants on demand.
* Efficiently segment and manage customers into industry defined groups such as Healthcare, Finance, and more.
* Segment tenants by reallocating credits as needed, between tenants under management.
* Isolate your customer's data in adherence with established security best practices.
* Get centralized visibility into security telemetry such as incidents, attack paths, and misconfigurations.
* Create policy groups from a set of out-of-the-box policies and custom policies. Map policy groups to tenant groups from the console. 
* Manage modules by selectively enabling optional modules during tenant creation. 
* Get visibility into credit usage across all managed Prisma Cloud tenants.

=== Multitenant Management Console Features 

The Multitenant Management console features three dashboards that help you streamline the creation and management for tenants, policies and their related operations as shown below:

*Operation Alerts* 

On the Multitenant Management console you can select the bell icon to view *Operation Alerts* for the status of all actions that are performed by a user on the Multitenant Management console. The following operations are displayed on the alarm center: 

* Operation Name
* Operation Description 
* Mapping Policy
* When a user ‘maps’ a policy group to a tenant group.
* Unmapping Policy 
* When a user ‘unmaps’ a policy group from a tenant group.
* User Creation 
* Creation of user on the Multitenant Management console 
* Tenant Provisioning 
* When a user creates a tenant 
* Tenant Update
* When a user updates a tenant (such as, tenant group change, credit change)


Failed user initiated operations are listed as an entry on the *Operation Alerts* page. Additionally, users have the option to retry the failed operation. Click on the retry button available on the listing of each failed operation to retry a previous attempt. 


*Licensing Dashboard*

From the Multitenant Management console, select *Licensing* to view details about credits purchased, credits allocated, and the tenants groups that they are allocated to as shown below.

[NOTE]
====
You may experience an issue on the licensing dashboard, where there is a mismatch between the credits reported on a tenant group and the credits reported on the dashboard, when a tenant fails to create successfully.

To resolve this issue, retry the failed tenant create operation from the *Operations Alerts* panel. Alternatively, create a new tenant from the tenant creation workflow. 

This is a benign issue and only impacts the credits reported for the tenant on the tenant group on the licensing dashboard. It does not impact the accurate reporting of the quantity of credits purchased, credits allocated, or the balance.
