== Create and Manage Policy Groups

A policy group is a logical grouping of out-of-the-box and/or custom Prisma Cloud Policies. 


Follow the steps below to create *Policy Groups*:

. Select the *Policy Groups* tab from the Multitenant Management console. 

. Select *Create Policy Group* to launch the policy group creation workflow. 

. Enter a name for the Policy Group in the *Policy Group Name* field.

. Select the policies from the list that will be a part of the Policy Group. 

. View the policies selected and added to the policy group by clicking on the *Policies in this Group* tab. 

. Review the policies to confirm your selections and click *Save* to create the policy group. 


=== Create a Policy 

The Prisma Cloud Multitenant Management console also enables you to create a new policy called a custom policy. You can add a custom policy to a new or existing policy group to map the policy to tenants in a tenant group. 

Follow the steps below to create a custom policy:

. Navigate to the *Policy Groups* dashboard.

. Click *Create Policy* to launch the custom policy creation workflow. 

. On the new Prisma Cloud tenant window select *Home > Governance > Add Policy*.

. See https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/governance/create-a-policy[Create a Custom Policy] to complete the creation of your new policy.


=== Map a Policy Group to a Tenant Group 

Follow the steps below to map a policy group to a tenant group and extend the mapping onto the managed Prisma Cloud tenants.

. Navigate to the *Policy Groups* dashboard and select any policy group that you wish to map to a tenant.
+
tt:[NOTE:] Multiple policy groups can *only* be mapped to a single tenant group. It is not possible to map multiple policy groups to multiple tenant groups in the same operation. Repeat the mapping operation of policy groups that would be mapped to each independent tenant group. 

. Select *Map to Tenant Group*. 

. Select a tenant group to map the policy groups to. 

. Click *Confirm and Map* to complete mapping.
