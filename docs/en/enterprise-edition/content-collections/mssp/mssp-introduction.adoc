== Prisma Cloud Managed Security Service Provider


Effectively deliver security at scale with Prisma Cloud®'s Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) service. MSSP offers a  rich set of features that provides a centralized dashboard for the efficient management of a large number of tenants. 

With the MSSP console you can streamline the following functions: 

* Manage and operate a large number of tenants from a single console.
* Dynamically create and delete tenants on demand.
* Efficiently segment and manage customers into industry defined groups such as Healthcare, Finance, and more.
* Segment tenants by reallocating credits as needed, between tenants under management.
* Isolate customer data in adherence with established security best practices.
* Get centralized visibility into security telemetry such as incidents, attack paths and misconfigurations.
* Create policy groups from a set of out of the box policies and custom policies. Policy groups can be mapped to tenant groups from the MSSP console. 
* Module management — selective enablement of optional modules during tenant creation. 
* Visibility into credit usage across all Prisma Cloud tenants under management.
