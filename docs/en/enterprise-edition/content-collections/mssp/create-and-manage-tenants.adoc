== Create and Manage Tenants
 

Tenant Groups in MSSP are logical groupings of multiple managed Prisma Cloud tenants. Administer multiple tenants with ease by creating tenant groups and mapping individual tenants to them. Additionally, Policy groups can be mapped to tenant groups in order to apply the constituent policies of the policy group on to the individual tenants. 

Follow the steps below to create a Tenant Group:

. On the MSSP console, select the *Tenant Groups* tab. 

. Select *Create Tenant Group* and provide a name for the group. 

. Click *Save* to complete tenant group creation. 

=== Create Tenant 

A (managed) Prisma Cloud tenant can be created from the Tenant Group dashboard. 
When creating a tenant, the details pertaining to the user should be those of the end customer who will be the “owner” of the tenant. The email address specified will be used to send a Welcome email message to the user with instructions pertaining to account creation and use of the MSSP console. 

Step 1. Navigate to the “Tenant Groups” dashboard by clicking on the “Tenant Groups” tab. 




Step 2.  Click on the “Create Tenant” button. 

Step 3.  Provide the details pertaining to the Tenant (shown below)

Note: 
The First Name, Last Name and email address should be the details pertaining to the individual who will be “System Administrator” on the tenant.  This user will receive a welcome email from Prisma Cloud in order to manage and administer the Prisma Cloud tenant. 
The “Company Name” field should be the name of the company or organization to which the Tenant is provisioned for. 

Step 3.1 The tenant can be optionally assigned to a “Tenant Group” at this time. 

Note: Policy Groups can only be assigned to tenant groups. Therefore, if you know which tenant group this tenant should belong to, it is recommended to assign this tenant to that group at this time.  A tenant can alternatively be assigned to a group at a later time as well. 




Step 4.  Provide the License Configuration details. 

4.1 Select a license pool. 

4.2 Input the total number of credits to allocate to the tenant. 

Note: A minimum of 100 credits needs to be allocated to a tenant and the total number of credits cannot exceed the amount that is allocatable to the tenant. 




4.3 Select a “Plan Type” to assign to the Tenant. 

4.4 Click the “Next” button at the bottom of the page. 

4.5 Select the (non default) modules to enable on the tenant



Click ‘Next’ to continue. 

Step 5.  Review the summary and click the “Save” button. 


Click ‘Save’ to create the tenant. 


Limitations

Platform 

N/A

Users
All users created on the Prisma Cloud MSSP console are MSSP admins on the MSSP Console
A user created on the Prisma Cloud MSSP console will replicated and created as an Admin on all Prisma Cloud managed tenants 

Tenants
Once a tenant is deleted, the credits remain allocated to a tenant until the expiry of 120 days. Upon the lapse of 120 days, the credits will be made available to the pool from which they can be applied to other tenants. 

Constraints 
Policies mapped from the MSSP Console are immutable on the managed Prisma Cloud tenants.

MSSP admin users, mapped as system admins on the managed Prisma Cloud tenants cannot be deleted by an Admin on the managed Prisma Cloud tenants.

When a tenant is deleted, the credits that were allocated to the tenant will remain allocated to the tenant for a period of 120 days. Upon the lapse of the 120 day period post the deletion of a tenant, the credits will be available for use as part of the “Credits that are allocatable” pool. 



Known Issues 

An issue exists on the licensing dashboard wherein when a tenant fails to create successfully, there will be a mismatch, between the total number of credits reported on the tenant group (on the licensing page), with the credits reported on the main title card. 

It should be noted that this is a benign issue and only impacts the credits reported for the tenant on the tenant group (on the licensing dashboard). It does not however impact the accurate reporting of the credits purchased quantity, the credits allocated quantity or the balance.

Workaround: A user has a couple of options to workaround this issue: 
Retry the failed tenant create operation from the Operations alert panel. 
Create a new tenant from the Tenant creation workflow.
