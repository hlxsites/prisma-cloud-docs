== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Jira

Learn how to integrate Prisma® Cloud with Jira and receive Prisma Cloud alerts in your Jira accounts.

Integrate Prisma® Cloud with Jira to receive Prisma Cloud alert notifications directly in your Jira accounts. This integration automates the process of generating Jira tickets with your existing security workflow.

This integration is compatible with all Jira Cloud and Jira On-Premise versions. 

[NOTE]
====
If you have an existing Jira Integration on Prisma Cloud for versions below 9.0 and want to upgrade to Jira 9.0 or higher, you need to xref:configure-pc-on-jira-for-9-0-and-above[configure] and xref:setup-pc-on-jira-for-9-0-and-above[set up a new Jira Integration]. You cannot edit the existing integration to support the newer version.

Additionally, after creating a new Jira integration to support version 9.0 and above, you must add a new https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/administration/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/add-notification-template#add-jira-notification-template[Jira notification template] to ensure you receive alert notifications. You cannot update the existing notification template to support the newer version as it can lead to errors and will prevent you from receiving notifications.
