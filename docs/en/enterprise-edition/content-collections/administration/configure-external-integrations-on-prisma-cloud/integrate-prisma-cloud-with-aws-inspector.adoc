== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Amazon Inspector
Learn how to integrate Prisma® Cloud with Amazon Inspector.

Get a contextual view into cloud assets risks with Prisma Cloud's Amazon Inspector integration. Activate this integration to allow Prisma® Cloud to ingest vulnerability data and security best practice deviations to identify suspicious traffic to sensitive workloads, such as databases with known vulnerabilities.


[.procedure]
. Enable Amazon Inspector on your EC2 instances. To set up Amazon Inspector, see https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/set-up-amazon-inspector/[Amazon documentation].

. Enable read-access permissions to Amazon GuardDuty on the IAM Role policy.
+
The Prisma Cloud IAM Role policy you use to onboard your AWS setup needs to include these permissions:
+
* `inspector:Describe*`
* `inspector:List*`
+
tt:[NOTE] If you used the CFT templates to onboard your AWS account, the Prisma Cloud IAM Role policy already has the permissions required for Amazon Inspector.

. After the Prisma Cloud service begins ingesting Amazon Inspector data, you can use RQL queries for visibility into the host vulnerability information collected from it.
+
.. Navigate to *Investigate > Search* page.
+
... To search for *Config Query*, enter the following RQL query.  
+
----
config from cloud.resource where finding.type = 'AWS Inspector Runtime Behavior Analysis'
----
+
*AWS Inspector Runtime Behavior Analysis*— Fetches all resources which are in violation of one or more rules reported by the AWS Runtime Behavior Analysis package.
+
----
config from cloud.resource where finding.type = 'AWS Inspector Security Best Practices'
----
+
*AWS Inspector Security Best Practices*— Fetches all resources which are in violation of one or more rules reported by the AWS Inspector security best practices package.

... Select an asset to view the *Finding Types* side panel. The panel lists threats or security issues associated with the asset.

----
+
----
network from vpc.flow_record where dest.resource IN ( resource where finding.type = 'AWS Inspector Security Best Practices' )
----
+
The query returns a visual representation of the assets for further investigation.
