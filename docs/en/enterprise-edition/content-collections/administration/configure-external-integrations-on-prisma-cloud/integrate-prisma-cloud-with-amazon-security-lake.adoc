== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Amazon Security Lake

Learn how to integrate Prisma Cloud with Amazon Security Lake.

Amazon Security Lake offers a comprehensive view of security data across sources of your choice in your cloud and on-premises environments. Prisma Cloud delivers security intelligence to Amazon Security Lake using the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) standard. Integrating Prisma Cloud with Amazon Security Lake helps you protect your cloud workloads, applications, and data with greater visibility and context into cloud security issues.

//With ingestion of Prisma Cloud OCSF-compliant vulnerability security data into Amazon Security Lake, analysts can break down data silos, query data in-place, and perform big data analytics at scale.

You should receive a success message and a test message should be posted to your S3 bucket. The integration will be listed on the *Integrations* page, where you can *View*, *Edit*, or *Delete* the integration from the *Actions* panel. 

Navigate to the S3 bucket in your AWS environment. You should be able to see the findings sent to the S3 bucket in the parquet format.

NOTE: Prisma Cloud allows only one Security Lake integration at a time. From Prisma Cloud, only *Host vulnerability findings* are written in to Security Lake.
