== Integrate Prisma Cloud with AWS Security Hub
Learn how to integrate Prisma® Cloud with AWS Security Hub so that you can view and monitor your security posture on AWS Security Hub.

Integrate Prisma® Cloud with AWS Security Hub for centralized visibility into security and compliance risks associated with your cloud assets on the AWS Security Hub console.

As a part of the integration, Prisma Cloud monitors your AWS cloud assets. It sends alerts about resource misconfigurations, compliance violations, network security risks, and anomalous user activities directly to the AWS Security Hub console providing a centralized and comprehensive view of the cloud assets deployed on your AWS accounts.

NOTE: Prisma Cloud integration with AWS Security Hub is not supported for US Gov Cloud regions.

If you have integrated an AWS Organization account with Security Hub on Prisma Cloud, it is considered a standalone account. This means you will only receive alerts for the master account on Security Hub, not its child accounts. To receive alerts for every child account linked to that master account, you must repeat Steps 1 through 3 and then configure alert rules for each account.
