== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Cortex XSOAR

Learn how to integrate Prisma® Cloud with Cortex XSOAR (formerly Demisto^®^) to send alerts and enable multi-step automated remediation using Cortex XSOAR playbooks.

You can integrate Prisma Cloud and Cortex XSOAR (formerly Demisto) to create an outbound or push-based connection. This integration allows you to send alerts generated by policy violations from Prisma Cloud to Cortex XSOAR. Using this integration, your Security Operations team can define custom or out-of-the-box playbooks on Cortex XSOAR to create multi-step workflows for incident management of your cloud resources that is an alternative to the https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/prisma-cloud-v2[pull-based integration] that you can configure from Cortex XSOAR.

Using the policy ID in the alert, Cortex XSOAR categorizes the alert as a specific incident type. For an incident type, the Prisma Cloud alert payload is mapped to a Cortex XSOAR layout that specifies the incident fields for data classification and mapping on Cortex XSOAR. The current list of incident types is AWS CloudTrail Misconfiguration, AWS EC2 Instance Misconfiguration, AWS IAM Policy Misconfiguration, Azure AKS Misconfiguration, Azure Network Misconfiguration, Azure SQL Misconfiguration, Azure Storage Misconfiguration, GCP Compute Engine Misconfiguration, GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration, and Prisma Cloud. If the policy ID is not categorized to a specific incident type, it is automatically mapped to the generic Prisma Cloud incident type. Every incident type is mapped to a Cortex XSOAR layout and associated with a playbook to enable autoremediation of the violating resource, except for the generic Prisma Cloud incident type.

On autoremediation, Prisma Cloud performs a scan to detect that the issue is resolved and marks the alert as resolved.

Currently, this integration does not support the use of notification templates and Prisma Cloud does not receive state change notifications from Cortex XSOAR after it resolves an open alert.

=== Set Up the Integration on Cortex XSOAR

Before you can view Prisma Cloud alerts as incidents on Cortex XSOAR, you need to install the *Prisma Cloud by Palo Alto Networks* content pack from the *Marketplace*. The content pack includes the incident fields required for this push-based integration. When you have the content pack, the classifier, incident types, and layouts are available automatically.

Cortex XSOAR maps Prisma Cloud alerts to out-of-the-box incident types such as AWS CloudTrail Misconfiguration, AWS EC2 Instance Misconfiguration, AWS IAM Policy Misconfiguration, Azure AKS Misconfiguration, Azure Network Misconfiguration, Azure SQL Misconfiguration, Azure Storage Misconfiguration, GCP Compute Engine Misconfiguration, GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration, and Prisma Cloud. If the policy ID is not categorized to a specific incident type, it is automatically mapped to the generic Prisma Cloud incident type by default. The out-of-box, _Incident Classifier & Mapping_ is required for classifying incidents to the correct incident type and mapping the fields in the Prisma Cloud alert payload to the Cortex XSOAR incident fields. When an incident is created, the playbook attached to the incident type automatically executes.

Find all the https://github.com/demisto/content/tree/master/Packs/PrismaCloud/Playbooks[Cortex XSOAR playbooks] that are available to support remediation on Prisma Cloud for example Prisma Cloud Remediation - AWS EC2 Instance Misconfiguration and Prisma Cloud Remediation - GCP VPC Network Misconfiguration; search for `playbook-PCR_` .
