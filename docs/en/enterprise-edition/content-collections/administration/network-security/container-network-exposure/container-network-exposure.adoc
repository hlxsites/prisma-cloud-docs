== Container Network Exposure

CNA correlates multiple data points, including routing paths and security policy configurations using graph-based modeling and then runs a complex calculation to evaluate the net effective action (ALLOW or DENY) for an IP packet from Source-A to Destination-B. The true network exposure evaluation is based on parsing the configuration of the resource(s) to determine all possible network paths. Prisma Cloud does not send actual traffic or read network logs for performing this network path analysis.

//Prisma Cloud Satellite is a Kubernetes operator designed to be lightweight and non-intrusive, which focuses on enabling users to manage other Prisma Cloud applications lifecycle. On its first release, Satellite automatically deploys the Discovery application, which is used by Prisma Cloud to ingest K8s artifacts for analysis by CNA and AppDNA. For the container exposure use case, Prisma Cloud correlates the K8s configuration with the VPC network information to determine which K8s Components are Internet Exposed, the deployments and endpoints behind each service and it builds a network graph to display the network path.
