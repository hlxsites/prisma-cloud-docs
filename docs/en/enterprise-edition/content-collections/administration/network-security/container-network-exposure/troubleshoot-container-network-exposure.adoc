== Troubleshoot Container Network Exposure Issues

=== Onboarding Issues

If Container Exposure is not generating any alerts or your RQL queries always return empty:

//ask PM about resources vs. assets?

* Make sure all Prisma Cloud resources in the specific cluster are in the *Running* state.

* Check the Satellite status in the Prisma Cloud UI (*Settings > Providers > K8s Satellite*):
+
** If the resources in the cluster are running and the Satellite status is *Active*:
+
*** Make sure the cluster is onboarded and the Satellite operator is installed successfully,

*** Wait until the first ingestion cycle is completed (24 hours).

** If the Satellite status is *Pending Install*:
+
*** Ensure resources under K8s `pc-satellite` namespace are in the *Running* or *Completed* state,

*** Check `prismacloud-satellite-manager` pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod name> -n pc-satellite`,

*** Ensure that the K8s Node has sufficient resources.

** If the Satellite status is *Offline*:
+
*** The K8s cluster may not be active in the respective cloud service provider.


=== Search and Investigate Issues

If the SLA for resource ingestion is met and there aren't any results for the query:

* Run the same RQL search as the previous time, however change the `effective.action` value to `Any` and check if you see a 'Reject' path.
+
** If you see a 'Reject' path, it indicates that certain security configurations, such as security groups, NACLS, firewalls, NSGs, or Kubernetes network policies, are hindering the flow of traffic.

** If you do not see a 'Reject' path, that is no path is observed to K8s Service, run the same RQL query without any Kubernetes-specific filters, ensure that the `effective.action` is `Any` and `dest.resource.type` is set to `Instance`.

** If you see an 'Allow' path for the new RQL query above, that is to the K8s Nodes within the K8s cluster, follow the steps listed below to troubleshoot:
+
*** Ensure that the K8s service is of type 'LoadBalancer'
+
**** Verify that the service slated for exposure has been assigned an External-IP.
//if not issue with provisioning the load balancer.

**** Ensure that the K8s service intended for investigation has endpoints, by running the `kubectl describe service <service name> -n <namespace name>` command. If no endpoints are observed, check the selectors used in the K8s service because there may be a problem with the K8s deployment.

**** Check if the target port in the K8s Service aligns with the actual container port where the application runs inside the pod. 

NOTE: If each of the above troubleshooting steps work as expected, there can be an issue with K8s resource ingestion.

* If there is a 'Reject' path to the nodes, it indicates that certain security configurations, such as security groups, NACLS, firewalls, NSGS are hindering the flow of traffic.

* If there is no path, there might be an issue with resource ingestion of non-k8s resources, such as instances or load balancers.
