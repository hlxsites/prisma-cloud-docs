== Satellite Deployment

You can deploy Satellite manually or automated using the UI or the API.

NOTE: The deployment of the Satellite operator across multiple namespaces within the same cluster is not supported. If you remove the Satellite operator from the Kubernetes cluster, the Kubernetes data that is ingested through that operator is immediately deleted.

//Added above Note based on CNS-9947 and CNS-10044

. Copy the *Helm* upgrade/install command and run it in your selected cluster.
+
NOTE: A unique identifier is created each time a Helm chart is generated and it acts as a cluster identifier. Therefore, you cannot reuse the Helm chart across different clusters.

. As soon as the Helm chart is generated, the cluster will be in *Pending* state, until the Satellite gets deployed and starts reporting to Prisma Cloud. It can take a few minutes for the Satellite to get successfully deployed.
+
Once the deployment is complete, the cluster state will change to *Active*. 
+
Once a cluster is in the Active state, it sends keep-alives to Prisma Cloud every 30 minutes. If there is a communication issue or if the Satellite gets removed from the cluster, the object will move into an *Offline* state until the communication is re-established or the object is deleted on the Prisma Cloud console.
