== Prisma Cloud Applications Inventory

Once you onboard your cloud accounts, Prisma Cloud automatically initiates a scan to discover assets based on predefined criteria. This process intelligently groups the scanned assets into *Applications*, which are essential constructs within your cloud environment.

The application-centric grouping provides visibility into all your applications and their assets, and understand their relationships across your cloud environment.

By leveraging this application context, you can gain valuable insights into your security landscape. You will be able to investigate alerts, prioritize risk mitigation efforts, and swiftly remediate vulnerabilities based on the business criticality of your applications. 

Use the *Applications Inventory* to inspect and review applications with critical alerts and vulnerabilities. This will help you gain deeper insights into the impacted applications.


[#app-inventory-prereq]
=== Prerequisites

. Ensure you have all the required permissions enabled in Prisma Cloud to view the applications. To assign permissions for various roles, see the xref:../administration/prisma-cloud-admin-permissions.adoc[permissions page].

* You can select up to 5 asset tags. These asset tags operate using an *AND* function, meaning all selected tags must match for an application to be included in the scan.

* You can add up to 100 custom discovery criteria to enhance the scan parameters. Once you reach the maximum criteria limit, you must delete an existing one to add new criteria.
====

. (tt:[Optional]) Select an asset tag from the list to associate the *Business Criticality* of that application.

. (tt:[Optional]) Select an asset tag from the list to associate with the *Business Owner* of that application.

. *Save* the criteria.
+
These custom discovery criteria will be applied during the next scan cycle, ensuring the scan results are tailored to your specific needs.
+

[.task]
[#appdna-create-apps]
=== Create Applications

You can manually create a new application that will be included in the next scan. To create a new application, perform the following steps:      

[.procedure]

. Click on *Create Application*.

. Enter an *Application Name*.

. (tt:[Optional]) Enter a *Description* of the application.

. Under *Application Definition*, add the required *Tag Keys* and *Tag Values* by selecting from the list to define the application tags.
+
[NOTE]
====
(tt:[NOTE])

* Prisma Cloud finds applications based on the case-sensitive cloud asset tags you select. Once you save the definition tags, you cannot modify them. You must create a new application and specify the tag keys and values again.

* You can select up to 5 tags. These tags operate using an *AND* function, meaning all selected tags must match for an application to be included in the scan.
====

. (tt:[Optional]) Select Repositories.
+
You can only select repositories if you are subscribed to xref:../application-security/get-started/enable-application-security.adoc[Application Security] on Prisma Cloud. You can include up to 100 repositories to be associated with the application.

. (tt:[Optional]) Enter additional information to define the application, such as:
+
.. *Business Criticality*.

.. *Business Owner*.

.. *Environment* where the application is deployed.
