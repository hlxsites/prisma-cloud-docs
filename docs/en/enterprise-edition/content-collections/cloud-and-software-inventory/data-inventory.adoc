== Data Inventory

The Data Inventory (navigate to *Inventory > Data*) provides comprehensive insights into the assets being monitored, including a summary of data cards that display the exposure status of various objects, such as public, sensitive, or flagged for malware. It also offers a detailed inventory view of objects organized by accounts, account groups, assets, objects, and regions. Multiple filters such as Time Range, Asset Name, Asset Exposure, Object Profile, and Object Pattern are available to help you locate specific assets or objects of interest.
