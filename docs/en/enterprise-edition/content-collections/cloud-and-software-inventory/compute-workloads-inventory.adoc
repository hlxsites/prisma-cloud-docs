== Compute Workloads Inventory

As you onboard your Cloud accounts, Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory provides a comprehensive view of Compute workloads (containers and hosts) within your workload environment. This visibility facilitates discovery, risk assessment, and securing assets in runtime. The inventory aids in evaluating and preventing breaches on Cloud workloads, allowing you to review and safeguard Kubernetes clusters in your deployment during runtime.

*Prerequisites*

* Onboard your Cloud account and deploy the Kubernetes clusters.
* xref:../runtime-security/install/deploy-defender/deploy-defender.adoc[Deploy Defenders] (Orchestrator in this case) to monitor your K8s clusters and enable the admission controller.

// In the Asset Inventory for Compute Workload, you can:

// * Discover compute workload assets (container images and hosts) across your Cloud environment.
// * Get a total count of container images and hosts across your workload.
// * View a total count of vulnerable images and hosts.

// ** Identify the Cloud providers of the images and filter the vulnerable images.
// ** View how the container images are spread across the application lifecycle.
// ** Assess the images and hosts for the most impactful vulnerabilities, based on CVEs that are critical, exploitable, or patchable.
// ** Assess the vulnerable hosts for attack paths, alerts, risk factors, and vulnerabilities.

Resources Included in Runtime Protection by Defenders:

* Discover compute workload assets (container images and hosts) across your Cloud environment.
* Obtain a total count of container images and hosts within your workload.
* View a total count of vulnerable images and hosts.
* Identify the Cloud providers of the images and filter the vulnerable images.
* Understand how container images are distributed across the application lifecycle.
* Assess images and hosts for critical vulnerabilities, based on CVEs that are critical, exploitable, or patchable.
* Evaluate vulnerable hosts for attack paths, alerts, risk factors, and vulnerabilities.

Resources Included in Agentless Scanning of Non-Runtime Resources:

* Discover relationships between registry images and deployed images to prioritize compute workloads based on impactful vulnerabilities.
* Assess container images to understand image-related risks.
* Trace the spread of vulnerable container images across application lifecycle stages.
* Evaluate hosts to assess the security posture based on critical and high CVEs, exploitable vulnerabilities, or patchable issues.
* View alerts profile, policies violated, vulnerabilities profile, risky processes, risky packages, and associated labels for container images and hosts.

=== Discover Compute Workload Assets

The findings on *Inventory > Compute Workloads* help you to assess the impact of the vulnerable container images and hosts on your application lifecycle, identify the top impacting vulnerabilities based on critical CVEs, and identify the Cloud providers these assets belong to.

You can discover the relationships between the registry images and the deployed images and prioritize the compute workloads based on the top impactful vulnerabilities to focus on. This gives you a better understanding of your security posture and helps to identify the image and host-related security risks.

==== Risk Assessment for Container

On *Inventory > Compute Workloads > Container Images* you can assess the container images to understand the image-related risks.

// Trace how the vulnerable container images are spread across your application's *Lifecycle stages*.
// You can sort the results based on images with the most impactful vulnerabilities, running containers with these vulnerable images, and the most recent scanned vulnerable images.

By tracing how vulnerable container images are distributed across your application's lifecycle stages, you can prioritize addressing the most critical vulnerabilities. You can sort results based on images with the most impactful vulnerabilities, running containers with these vulnerable images, and the most recently scanned vulnerable images.

When selecting a specific container image, you can access detailed information such as the alerts profile, violated policies, vulnerabilities profile, risky processes, risky packages installed in the image, and associated labels. This level of insight allows you to make informed decisions about mitigating risks associated with container images.

// Select a container image, to get more information, such as the alerts profile and the policies violated, vulnerabilities profile, risky processes, risky packages installed in the image, and labels associated with that image.

==== Risk Assessment for Hosts

On *Inventory > Compute Workloads > Hosts* you can assess the security posture of hosts based on critical and high CVEs, exploitable vulnerabilities, and patchable issues. By filtering and sorting the list of vulnerable hosts, you can prioritize addressing the most impactful vulnerabilities to enhance the overall security of your environment.

When selecting a host, you can access detailed information including attack paths, audit trail, alerts profile, violated policies, threat detection findings, risk factors, impactful vulnerabilities, package information, over-permissive IAM details, and the host's relationships with other assets. This comprehensive view of host-related risks enables you to take proactive measures to mitigate vulnerabilities and strengthen the security of your infrastructure.

// You can filter the vulnerable hosts and also sort the list based on the most impactful vulnerabilities, and the recent vulnerable hosts scanned.

// Select a host to view more information such as the attack paths, audit trail, alerts profile, the policies violated, threat detection findings on the host, risk factors and impactful vulnerabilities, package information, over-permissive IAM details on the host, and the host's relationship with other assets.

In the attack paths, you can select a CVE to fix the vulnerability in Code (*Fix in Code*) and submit a PR or *View Details* to mitigate the risk and eliminate the weak link leading to the host.
