== Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory

Use the Asset Inventory dashboard to see up-to-date information on all cloud assets that you are using Prisma Cloud to monitor and secure.

On the Asset Inventory (*Inventory > Assets*), the Asset Trend visualization displays 90-days trend information at all times, and the Asset History provides a historical view into the assets within the inventory. 

Each row displays the service name with details on the cloud type, assets with alerts, assets with vulnerabilities, and the percentage of assets that pass policy checks to which you want to adhere. The links in each column help you explore and gain the additional context you may need to take action. The *Data as of:* value indicates the freshness of the snapshot of the data.

The *Assets with Alerts* column displays the total number of assets by alert severity for a specified group of assets and the *Assets with Vulnerabilities* column displays the total number of assets by vulnerability severity for a specified group of assets. You can filter to view the inventory based on Cloud Type, Azure Resource Group, Compliance Requirement, Compliance Standard, Asset Type, Compliance Section, Account Group, Cloud Account, Cloud Region, Alert Severity, and Vulnerability Severity. 

//NOTE: If you use the _Key-Value_ *Asset Tag* filter and your environment has more that 1 million assets, the results will be inconclusive. Contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success representative for more details.

You can view the *Asset Explorer* by selecting a filterable subset of assets from the Asset Inventory. You can then select an asset from the Explorer view to access the Asset Detail view. Vulnerability Severity displays assets with known software vulnerabilities of a specific severity while Alert Severity displays assets with open alerts of a specific severity. You can use the Column Picker to show or hide columns.

The *Asset Detail View* allows you to deep dive into asset details to explore the security context uncovered by Prisma Cloud. It provides you with a focused view of the following asset details:

* *Header*
+
** *Asset Name* is displayed at the top of the header.
** *View Config* reveals the raw asset configuration JSON of the asset.
** *Finding Types* lists the different threats or security issues associated with the asset.

* *Tabs*
+
** *Overview*—Is the default tab and includes primary asset attributes. The "You are viewing the most recent data about this asset" text indicates that this is the most recent data for the asset regardless of the data roll-up time and it may be more up to date than the latest snapshot.

** *Attack Paths*—Identifies asset vulnerabilities that may correlate to a potential Attack Path.

** *Alerts*—Displays open alerts for the asset.

** *Vulnerabilities*—Displays Prisma Cloud and third-party vulnerabilities for the asset. 

** *Findings*—Displays Prisma Cloud findings along with third-party non-vulnerability findings for the asset.

** *Identity*—Displays xref:../administration/configure-iam-security/aws-cloud-identity-inventory.adoc[effective permissions] for the assets. 

** *Audit Trail*—Includes discovery, configuration changes, and alert and vulnerability events.

** *Relationships*—Displays tabular representation of related assets.

** *Objects*—Displays data objects within applicable assets.

//[NOTE]
//====
//You may see more failed resources on the Compliance Dashboard compared to the Asset Inventory. This is because the Asset Inventory only counts assets that belong to your cloud account, and the Compliance Dashboard includes foreign entities such as SSO or Federated Users that are not resources ingested directly from the monitored cloud accounts.
