== Visual Editor

The Visual Editor supports custom build policies for IaC, Secrets, and Licenses using attribute-based checks with AND/OR logic. IaC policies support both AND/OR logic, while Secrets and License policies currently only support OR logic.

[.procedure]

. Under *Governance*, select *Add Policy* > *Config*.
. Fill in the fields in the *Add Details* step of the wizard (refer to xref:custom-build-policies.adoc[Custom Build Policies])> *Next*.
+
The *IaC Policy Code Editor* is displayed by default in the *Create query* step of the wizard. 
//+
//In this example, you see the policy details for S3 Bucket ACL where log delivery is not recommended.
//+
//image::governance/visual-editor.png
//+
//Code Editor appears as a default view.

. Select *Visual Editor* from the menu next to the 'Scan' button.
. Select a policy type.  

. Configure the policy by selecting values in the provided fields.
+
* For Licenses, select a license type. Multiple types are supported
+
* For Secrets, add a Regular expression. Multiple 'OR' expressions are supported
+
* For IaC, see <<configure-iac,Configure Iac Custom Build Policies>> below. 

. Verify the policy's functionality. Note that test scans are only supported for IaC policies.
 
. Select *Next* to access Compliance Standards, and complete the process for creating a custom Build-time check policy (refer to xref:custom-build-policies.adoc[Custom Build Policies]).

=== Configure IaC Custom Build Policies

Limitation: The Visual Editor supports policy creation for Prisma Cloud's supported cloud service providers. For unsupported providers, use the Code Editor.

[.procedure]
. Repeat steps 1-4 above, selecting IaC as the policy type.
. Select *Category Type*.
+
Policies are categorized by type. Options include Elasticsearch, General, IAM, Kubernetes, Logging, Monitoring, Networking, Public, Secrets, Serverless, Storage, and Vulnerabilities. 
//+
//image::governance/visual-editor-2.png

. Select the target *Framework*.
+
NOTE: Framework options include: Terraform, Kubernetes, CloudFormation and Bicep.

. Select a *Cloud Provider*.

. Select a *Resource Type*.
+
NOTE: The Cloud Provider selection determines the available Resource Types and their corresponding syntax.

. Create a query: Select an *Attribute*, *Operator* and add a *Value*.
+
This query defines the matching condition to check if a resource contains a specific value or if a specific value exists.
+
NOTE: This query type allows users to build complex search criteria using multiple attribute-operator-value combinations. The initial query supports both AND and OR conditions for flexible filtering. You can further refine results by applying additional logic, providing granular control over data retrieval.

. Select *Scan* to verify your custom IaC code.
+
If your custom IaC code contains no errors, Prisma Cloud will display up to 30 resource results.
+
The following screenshot displays an example of results returned by a verified IaC policy.

NOTE: You are in Step 2 of Create Custom Policies for Build-Time Checks. You are required to complete the rest of the steps to see your new custom Build-time check policy on the Prisma Cloud console.

//was under query builder

//image::governance/visual-editor-6.png
//+
//In this example the query for S3 Bucket ACL policy will include *Attribute* as `acl`, the *Operator* is `Not equals` and the *Value* is `log-delivery-write`.
//+
//image::governance/visual-editor-7.png
//+
////+
NOTE: The Custom Policy "aws-networking-deny-public-ssh" uses 2 rules with arguments for cidr_blocks and to_port. You can create multiple  nested arguments for this policy. In this example,  to express a more complex ingress policy for an AWS security group you can use arguments like; `ingress.from_port`, `ingress.to_port`, `ingress.protocol`, `ingress.cidr_blocks`.
+
You can use And/OR logic to create a  rule with more than one query.
+
A policy may include layers of defined Attributes and Connection State, or both. To define the connection between the two AND/OR logic is used.

In this example you see the AND logic used.
