== Create an IAM Policy

// Create custom IAM policies in Prisma Cloud to monitor your AWS, Azure, or GCP environments to enforce identity management best practices.

Prisma Cloud provides the ability to create custom IAM policies to fulfill your organization’s IAM requirements. You can build a new IAM policy based on the `config from iam` RQL query and monitor the identities across your cloud environment.

[.procedure]
. Select *Governance*.

. Select *Add Policy > IAM*. 

. Enter your policy details—*Policy Name* and *Severity*.
+
(Optional) Add a *Description* and *Labels*.

. Check `Use Group/Cloud Service Account as violating resource` if you wish to view alert results on AWS role, Azure service principal or GCP account group.

. Select *Next* and build your RQL query.
+
The default option of *New Search* enables you to build a new RQL query from scratch while *Saved Search* enables you to use a RQL query that you previously saved. For example:

* `config from iam where source.cloud.service.name = 'iam' and source.cloud.resource.type = 'user' and source.cloud.resource.name = 'my-user'`
+
Returns the net effective permissions of a user in your cloud account named _my-user_.

* `config from iam where grantedby.cloud.entity.type = 'group' AND source.cloud.resource.type = 'user'`
+
Lists all effective permissions that have been granted to a user by any AWS IAM group.
+
A green check mark displays if you entered a valid query.

. Select the search button.

. *Save* the policy.
+
After you successfully create your new policy, it displays on the *Policies* page.
