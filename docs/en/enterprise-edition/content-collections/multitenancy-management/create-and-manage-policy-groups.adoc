A policy group is a logical grouping of out-of-the-box and/or custom Prisma Cloud Policies. The image below outlines policy and policy group creation.

Follow the steps below to create *PolicyGroups*:

. Select the *Policy Groups* tab from the MSSP console. 

. Select *Create Policy Group* to launch the policy group creation workflow. 

. Enter a name for the Policy Group in the *Policy Group Name* field.

. Select the policies from the list that will be a part of the policy group. 

. View the policies selected and added to the policy group by clicking on the *Policies in this Group* tab. 

. Review the policies to confirm your selections and click *Save* to create the policy group. 


=== Create a Policy 

The Prisma Cloud MSSP console also enables you to create a new policy called a custom policy. A custom policy can be added to a new or existing policy group, for the purpose of mapping the policy to tenants in a tenant group. 

Follow the steps below to create a custom policy:

. Navigate to the *Policy Groups* dashboard.

. Click on *Create Policy* to launch the custom policy creation workflow. 

. On the new Prisma Cloud tenant window select *Home > Governance > Add Policy*.

. Reference https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/governance/create-a-policy[Create a Custom Policy] to complete the creation of your new policy.


=== Map a Policy Group to a Tenant Group 

Map a policy group needs to a tenant group to extend the mapping onto the managed Prisma Cloud tenants as outlined below:

. Navigate to the *Policy Groups* dashboard and select any policy group that you wish to map to a tenant.

tt:[NOTE:] Multiple policy groups can  ONLY be mapped to a single tenant group. In other words, it is not possible to map multiple policy groups to multiple tenant groups in the same operation.  Repeat the mapping operation of policy groups that would be mapped to each independent tenant group. 

. Select *Map to Tenant Group*. 

. Select a tenant group to map the policy groups to. 

. Click on the *Confirm and Map* button to complete mapping.
