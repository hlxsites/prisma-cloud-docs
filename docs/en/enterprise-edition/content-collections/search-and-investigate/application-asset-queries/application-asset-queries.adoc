== Application Asset Queries

Use *Application Asset* queries to view your software development life cycle (SLDC) as a graphical representation that allows you to explore assets and connections, including data collected by Prisma Cloud from system environments and subscriptions.

This visibility allows you to perform an in-depth analysis of security issues across your entire engineering ecosystem. You can understand the assets in your environment and the relationships between them. 

You cannot save the Application Asset queries queries under *Saved Queries* or run *Background Jobs*.

From the Investigate page, you can access the Package Dependency graph that is within the Application Asset graph. You can explore the package dependencies from code repositories using the Simple Mode query builder and query about packages, licenses, and vulnerabilities. If the package you are exploring is a transitive one, you can view the dependency tree by clicking on the _indirect_ edge.

NOTE: Make sure you have registered with the Cloud Application Security SCA module. Use cases of the Supply Chain graph, such as Image Referencer and IaC Resources Exploration, are not yet integrated into the Application Asset Graph.
