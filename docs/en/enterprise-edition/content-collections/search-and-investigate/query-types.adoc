//The AppDNA query type is https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/rn/limited-ga-features-prisma-cloud/lga-features[Limited GA]. For more details, see the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/assets/pdf/app-dna-lga.pdf[AppDNA PDF].

* Asset Configuration
* Audit Event
* Permissions

The remaining query types are out of scope for Granular RBAC and not supported for any *Custom* roles:

[NOTE]
====
The query types that you see in the Prisma Cloud UI not only depend on the roles and permissions, but also if a feature (module) is enabled on the tenant or not.
