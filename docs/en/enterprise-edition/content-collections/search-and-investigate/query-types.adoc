The above query types are supported on all Prisma Cloud tenants and all Prisma Cloud https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/administration/prisma-cloud-admin-permissions#roles-all[Out of the Box] (OOTB) roles, for example System Admins have permissions to all of these query types.

//The AppDNA query type is https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/rn/limited-ga-features-prisma-cloud/lga-features[Limited GA]. For more details, see the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/assets/pdf/app-dna-lga.pdf[AppDNA PDF]. 
 
The supported query types for *Custom* roles are listed under *Settings > Access Control > Permission Group > Add Permission Group*. The *Custom* roles (as defined by granular RBAC features) only support the following query types:

* Asset
* Asset Configuration
* Audit Event
* Permissions
* Network
* Network Configuration 
 
The Application Asset, Vulnerability, and Application query types are out of scope for granular RBAC and not supported for *Custom* roles.

//Verify if "Available for all license types" or "Not applicable"

[NOTE]
====
The query types that you see in the Prisma Cloud UI not only depend on the roles and permissions, but also if a feature (module) is enabled on the tenant or not.
