== Explore Data and Create Custom Policies

You can explore your cloud security environment and combine the deep security context to find the risky areas you want your organization to focus on. For example, you want to find which assets in your cloud are impacted by the latest log5j vulnerability and to investigate the latest incidents identified in your environment and explore what risk factors could have contributed to the incident. You can point and click to quickly and easily explore your cloud assets and security data without the need to learn a new complex query language.

In the *Graph* mode, you can select a node to preview the highlights. Select *View Details* to view the asset details. *Attack Paths* display the attack paths applicable to the particular asset. *Alerts* display the alert details.

The graph displays nodes and edges, however, there are still too many results for you to take any meaningful action. To narrow down your search and cater to your specific needs, you can refine your query with a few simple clicks and add additional context. For example, you can add more asset types to broaden the scope if needed, or introduce new findings into the combination, or add other filters such as, cloud accounts to focus on a specific team or business unit.

In this case, consider you want to find out if any bad actor is utilizing these factors to conduct crypto mining activities. You can simply search for _crypto_ and add this finding to your query. If you also want to specifically find assets with critical vulnerabilities, you can easily add the corresponding filters before running the search again.

After re-running the search, you will get a newly rendered graph and your search results have narrowed down from many options to the most important one to help you focus. This also allows you to see not only what could go wrong, but also what has gone wrong in your environment. Finally, you can also expand the vulnerability group to view the specific CVEs and trigger remediation actions directly from here. 

Next, you can select *Save > Save as New Saved Query*, update the query title and description, and *Save* this as a new query. By default, the title for the query will be *Cloned:<query name>*.

=== Create Custom Policies

Most enterprises have specific requirements and want to create custom policies that are very specific to the organizational needs. After you have searched for assets based on asset attributes and security contexts, you can create custom policies for risky assets to better remediate risks and secure your cloud environments.

In the above example when you narrowed your search results to a specific query, you found a very unique and valuable attack path. Now, you have to make sure that there is a security guardrail to automatically alert your security teams if your application is at risk with this combination. 

Select *Save > Save as Policy*. Prisma Cloud saves the search before converting it to a policy. Select *Save and Create Policy* to add or update policy name, description (optional), severity, and labels (optional). In *Create a Query*, use the saved search or update the findings and launch a new search. Add *Recommendation for Remediation* (optional) and select *Submit* to create a new Attack Path policy based on the saved query.

With the powerful graph visualization provided by Prisma Cloud, you can now easily set up custom policies to further improve your security posture.
