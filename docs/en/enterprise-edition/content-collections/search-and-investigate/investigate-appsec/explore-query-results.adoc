== Analyze Query Results

After xref:build-query.adoc[building a query], you can analyze the results to perform an in-depth analysis of security issues across your entire engineering ecosystem.

The query result, displayed in *Graph View*, includes the following components:
* <<nodes-,Nodes>>: The assets of a repository. Can include entities
* <<edges-,Edges>>: The connections between nodes
* *Export*: Download graph data as a png image or JSON file
* *Controls*: Include zoom and reset 

[#nodes-]
=== Nodes

To view a node's details, click on a node on the graph or right-click on a node > *Info*.
The *Details* panel opens, displaying the node's details as well as entities grouped under the node. In addition, the node's edges and connections to other nodes are displayed on the graph.

==== Node Entities

Nodes of the same type are grouped and displayed under a single group node. A number in the node indicates that the node is a group node, as well as the number of entities in the group. You can view all entities, entity details, and extract an entity from the group and display it independently on the graph.

|Action
|Steps

|*View all entities of a group node*
|
* Open the group node *Details* panel:

Click on the group node > Select a node under the *Expanded nodes field*. The node is regrouped under the group node and is displayed under the *Collapsed node* field OR:

* Right-click on an extracted node on the graph > *Collapse*. The entity is regrouped in the group node.

|*Extract an entity from the group node*
|* Click on an entity in the *Details* panel.
The selected entity moves to the *Expanded* nodes field OR:
* Right-click on a group node > select *Expand* - see above

NOTE: When clicking on an entity in the Details panel, the entity is extracted from the node group and presented on the graph as an individual node.

|*View an extracted entity's details*
| * Click on the entity in the *Details* panel OR:
* Right-click on a group node on the graph > *Expand* > right-click on the extracted node > *Info*

|*Regroup extracted nodes*
| * Open the group node Details panel: Click on the group node > Select a node under the *Expanded* nodes field. The node is regrouped under the group node and is displayed under the *Collapsed node* field OR:
* Right-click on an extracted node on the graph > *Collapse*. The entity is regrouped in the group node.

|*Regroup all extracted nodes*
| Right-click on an extracted node on the graph > *Collapse All*. All extracted nodes are regrouped in the group node.

[#edges-]
==== Edges

Edges are the connections that display the relationships between nodes. The path arrow indicates the direction between the source and target node. 

===== Actions on Edges

* To view the relationship between a node and edge, click on a node. The node's connections to other nodes are displayed. Details of the relationship including the type direction of the relation are presented
* To view details of a connection: Click on a connection. The connection *Details* panel opens, displaying the source and target nodes connected by the connection, as well as the type of connection.
