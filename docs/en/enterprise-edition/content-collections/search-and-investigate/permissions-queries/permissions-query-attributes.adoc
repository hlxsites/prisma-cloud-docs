== Permissions Query Attributes

Learn about permissions query attributes.

Review your options when using userinput:[config from iam where]. Each attribute allows you to narrow your search criteria. As you use these attributes, the auto-suggestion feature shows the available expressions and the operators that are applicable for each attribute.

* *Source*—an identity that takes action on other cloud resources. A source can be any resource with permissions such as an IAM user, Azure Active Directory user, EC2 instance, Lambda function, and Azure virtual machine.

* *Destination*—any cloud resource on which an action has occurred on or is the target of the action.

* *Granter*—the group, role, or policy that grants permissions to the source to interact with the destination.

For example, an IAM user (source) who can add an entry to a DynamoDB table (destination) using the AWS managed policy of the group (granter entity) to which the user belongs.

You can use the following attributes in the permissions query:
