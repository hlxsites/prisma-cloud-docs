== Finding Types

//add definition on what is a Finding- Security detection or context. Alert is actionable and Finding is informational.

//not inc. labels, compliance standard, sections, an
//You must define the *Finding Type* at the policy level and the supported policy type for Config, Network, IAM, and Anomaly Policies. 

//View Finding Details is shown in Asset sidecar only > Document WAAS & Malware finding types and external finding types have "View Finding Details" link. Ext finding not supported in graph. 

In Prisma Cloud, all Findings are driven by Policies. Findings also inherit policy attributes, such as name, severity, and description. The *Finding Type* is a set of findings with a specific security focus. 

Each OOTB policy (except for Attack Path policies) is classified with a finding type. The finding type will be displayed as <unclassified> for custom policies, which also includes policies cloned from OOTB policies.

//If you want to clone an OOTB policy without cloning first, the finding.type field will not be editable. However, if you edit a custom policy without cloning it, you will be able to edit the finding.type field.

//No custom-finding type support is required. Custom Policies will have this param as optional. Finding Type in RQL will be a filter criterion for search but will NOT be allowed by Risk Engine/policy evaluation.
//From *Inventory > Assets*, the Findings displays Prisma Cloud findings along with third-party non-vulnerability findings for the asset. 
//The *Action* column always displays a link/icon?, but if the Finding has no action, that link button is greyed out (un-clickable). Darwin UI did not change the fundamental of a finding type, if it did not have a link before, it will not have a link now.  
//To address: How can customer know the Finding type is for Compute or CSPM? How can they identify, for which Type they are supposed to see Findings details and for which type they shouldnâ€™t?

|*Finding Type*
|*Description*

|Bot Activity
|A WAAS detection of web activity performed by an automated tool known as a bot.

//Command and Control

//Compliance

|Config Tampering
|Findings that identify alternation on critical configurations that may pose an escalated security risk.

//Credential Access

|Cross Account Trust
|A scenario where a cloud account provides access to some of its resources or services to a different cloud account.

//Data Exfiltration

|Defense Evasion
|A scenario where an attacker performs actions to evade detection of their actions by security controls.

//Discovery

|High Privileged Role
|An IAM role that has (risky) excessive access permissions to a cloud resource or service.

//Initial Access

|Internet Exposure
|A cloud asset, usually a compute resource such as a VM or a Container that is accessible from the public Internet.

|Keys And Secrets
|Insecure findings related to keys and secrets.

//Lateral Movement

|Malware
|The detection of software intentionally designed to cause damage, steal data, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems or networks.

|Misconfiguration
|A misconfiguration of a cloud asset, service or account, which may introduce a security weakness and allow malicious users to abuse it.

|MFA
|Multi-factor authentication is not enabled for some user actions.

//Network Anomaly

//Network Reachability

|Overly Permissive Resource
|Cloud resources can be accessed by any user due to the overly permissive IAM policy configuration. It differs from the INTERNET_EXPOSURE finding type, mainly identifying the resources with unrestricted inbound network firewall rules.

|Privilege Escalation
|A scenario where a malicious user can potentially elevate their privileges to an asset or a service.

|Reconnaissance
|Potentially malicious reconnaissance activity performed.

|Resource Hijacking
|Potentially unauthorized utilization of cloud computing resources by an attacker.

|Sensitive Data
|The detection of sensitive data such as credit card information, PII, usernames, and so on.

|SSH Brute Force
//Brute Force Attack?
|Findings that identify the use of trial and error to guess information like passwords and encryption keys, attempting to gain unauthorized access to a system.

|Suspicious IAM Activity
|Findings that identify the IAM actions or activities that are unusual or may pose an elevated risk.

//Unauthorized Access

//Unclassified

|Unencrypted Data
|Data that is stored, transmitted, or processed in plain text or a format that is easily readable without the use of encryption, posing a significant security risk.

|Unused Privileges
|IAM access permissions that have not been used for a certain period. These permissions are potentially unnecessary for the user/entity's normal operation.

|User Anomaly
|Suspicious cloud account user activity that could potentially point to malicious user behavior.

//Vulnerability

|Weak Password
//or Weak Authentication?
|The authentication mechanism in use is flawed, less secure, or susceptible to attacks like brute force.

|Web Attack
|A WAAS detection of an active web attack performed by a potentially malicious user.

//Web Scraping

//Verify the 36 that are shown in the UI and the below from PM GDoc:
//UNUSES_PRIVILEGES: An IAM role that has (risky) excessive access permissions to a cloud resource or service.
//INSUFFICIENT_LOGGING_MONITORING: Cloud resources with the cloud-native logging or monitoring features disabled.
//INSUFFICIENT_BACKUP: Cloud resources with the cloud-native backup features disabled.
//SUSPICIOUS_TRAFFIC: Network traffic originated from or destined to IPs previously known for bot/ransomware/malware activities. It also identifies the use of unusual network protocols in cloud environments.
//LEGACY_FEATURE: Outdated software, policy, protocol, or feature is in use.
//TOR_TRAFFIC: Network traffic originating from known TOR nodes reach cloud environments. TOR attempts to hide the source IP and anonymize the traffic originators' identities.
//INFORMATION: Findings that notify information not necessarily security issues but need users' attention.
