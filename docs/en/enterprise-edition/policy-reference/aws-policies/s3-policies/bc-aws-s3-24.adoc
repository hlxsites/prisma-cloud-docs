=== Description 


This policy is designed to prevent configuration policies that could potentially lock out non-root users from accessing S3 buckets. This check is vital for maintaining access control in AWS environments and ensuring that bucket policies do not inadvertently create security risks by overly restrictive configurations.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_s3_bucket, aws_s3_bucket_policy
* *Argument:* policy

Do not allow all actions, principals, and resources in an S3 policy.
