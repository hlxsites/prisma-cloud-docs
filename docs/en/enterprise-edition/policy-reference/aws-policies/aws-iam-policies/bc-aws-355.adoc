=== Description

This policy is ensuring that no IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies on AWS (Amazon Web Services) allow the use of "*" as a statement's resource for restrictable actions. Allowing "*" can be dangerous as it means "all", including all possible services and resources, which can lead to a much wider range of access than intended. This can potentially expose sensitive information and actions, allowing for unauthorized manipulation of resources. By restricting the use of "*", we reduce the chance of giving an actor more permissions than they need, a concept known as the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), and thus minimize potential damage.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_iam_policy, aws_iam_role_policy, aws_iam_user_policy, aws_iam_group_policy, aws_ssoadmin_permission_set_inline_policy
* *Arguments:* policy

Check your AWS IAM policy and identify if there are any resources where action is allowed to "*". This kind of policy allows full access to all resources which can potentially lead to security risks like unauthorized access to data, service disruption etc. 

The fix here is to provide specified resources in the policy instead of `"*"` for the field `Resource` within the respective `Statement` block.

Example:
[source,go]
----
resource "aws_iam_policy" "fail" {
  ...
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
-        Resource = "*"
+        Resource = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/*"
      },
    ]
  })
}
