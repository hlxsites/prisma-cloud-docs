                === Description

                This policy detects whether an S3 bucket in AWS has a lifecycle configuration or not. A lifecycle configuration on an S3 bucket helps to manage objects so they can be automatically transitioned to other storage classes or expire after a certain period. This is crucial for cost effective data management and storage optimization.

                === Fix - Buildtime
                
                *Terraform*
                
                * *Resource:* aws_s3_bucket
                * *Arguments:* lifecycle_rule

                To fix the issue, it is needed to configure a lifecycle_rule under the respective S3 bucket in your terraform file specifying the id, status, prefix, transition, and expiration.

                Secure code example:

                [source,go]
                ----
                resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
                  bucket = "bucket"
                  acl    = "private”

                  lifecycle_rule {
                    id      = "expire"
                    status  = "Enabled"
                    prefix  = "logs/"
                    transition {
                      days          = 30
                      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
                    }
                    expiration {
                      days = 90
                    }
                  }
                }
                ----

                The above code defines a lifecycle configuration rule for the S3 bucket "bucket". The rule "expire" applies to objects with keys beginning with "logs/", transitions those objects to the STANDARD_IA storage class after 30 days, and then expires the objects 90 days after creation. This helps to reduce costs and ensure correct object lifecycle management.
