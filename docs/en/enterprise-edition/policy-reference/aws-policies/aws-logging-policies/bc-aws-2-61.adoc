=== Description

This policy detects whether an S3 bucket in AWS has a lifecycle configuration or not. A lifecycle configuration on an S3 bucket helps to manage objects so they can be automatically transitioned to other storage classes or expire after a certain period. This is crucial for cost effective data management and storage optimization.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_s3_bucket
* *Arguments:* lifecycle_rule

To fix the issue, it is needed to configure a lifecycle_rule under the respective S3 bucket in your terraform file specifying the id, status, prefix, transition, and expiration.

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "bucket"
  acl    = "private‚Äù

  lifecycle_rule {
    id      = "expire"
    status  = "Enabled"
    prefix  = "logs/"
    transition {
      days          = 30
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }
    expiration {
      days = 90
    }
  }
}
----

The above code defines a lifecycle configuration rule for the S3 bucket "bucket". The rule "expire" applies to objects with keys beginning with "logs/", transitions those objects to the STANDARD_IA storage class after 30 days, and then expires the objects 90 days after creation. This helps to reduce costs and ensure correct object lifecycle management.
