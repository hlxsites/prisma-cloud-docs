=== Description

This policy is checking to make sure that EventBridge Scheduler Schedule in AWS utilizes a Customer Managed Key (CMK) for encryption. This is crucial for maintaining secure data practices because CMKs offer increased control over key rotation, allowing a system administrator to manually rotate, disable, or re-enable a CMK. Without the use of a CMK, encryption keys will be solely managed by AWS, leading to less flexibility and potential security risks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_scheduler_schedule
* *Arguments:* kms_key_arn

To fix this issue, you should use a Customer Managed Key (CMK) for the EventBridge Scheduler Schedule.
