=== Description

This policy is checking to verify that EC2 Auto Scaling groups in AWS are utilizing EC2 launch templates. EC2 launch templates define instance configuration for compute resources. They provide a way for you to save a launch configuration that you can reuse, which helps in maintaining the consistency of configurations and also speeds up the deployment process. 

Not using EC2 launch templates can lead to several issues:
1. Inconsistency: Manual configuration for every instance may lead to inconsistencies and errors, which can in turn lead to security vulnerabilities.
2. Slow Deployment: Not using launch templates can result in a slower deployment process. Every time you need to launch a new instance, you would have to manually configure all the settings.
3. Troubleshooting Difficulty: If instances are manually configured, troubleshooting can become complex as you need to identify the configuration for each instance separately.
4. Scaling inefficiencies: Since auto-scaling groups adjust the number of instances on the fly according to load, not using a standard launch template would make this scaling inefficient and error-prone. 

Therefore, it is important for the best practice and efficient deployments to use EC2 launch templates in AWS auto-scaling groups.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_autoscaling_group
* *Arguments:* launch_template

To fix this issue, you need to refactor the EC2 AutoScaling group resource to use EC2 launch templates, rather than launch configurations.

[source,hcl]
```
resource "aws_launch_template" "example" {
  image_id      = "ami-0c94855ba95c574c8"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "example"
  }
}

resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "example" {
  desired_capacity = 1
  max_size         = 1
  min_size         = 1

+ launch_template {
+   id      = aws_launch_template.example.id
+   version = aws_launch_template.example.latest_version
+ }
}
```
