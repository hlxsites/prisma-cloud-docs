=== Description

This policy detects AWS API Gateway endpoints that do not use client certificate authentication. Client certificate authentication provides an additional layer of security by requiring clients to present a valid certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) in order to authenticate and establish a secure connection with the API Gateway endpoint.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_api_gateway_stage
* *Arguments:* client_certificate_id

To fix the issue, the `client_certificate_id` argument should be provided in the `aws_api_gateway_stage` resource. This argument allows you to specify the identifier of the ClientCertificate resource that represents the client certificate to use for authentication.

Secure code example:

[source,terraform]
----
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "example" {
  stage_name        = "prod"
  rest_api_id       = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.example.id
  deployment_id     = aws_api_gateway_deployment.example.id
+ client_certificate_id = aws_api_gateway_client_certificate.example.id
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_client_certificate" "example" {
  certificate_body = filebase64("client_certificate.pem")
  certificate_chain = filebase64("certificate_chain.pem")
  private_key = filebase64("private_key.pem")
}
----

In the above code example, the `aws_api_gateway_stage` resource includes the `client_certificate_id` argument which references the `aws_api_gateway_client_certificate` resource. This ensures that client certificate authentication is enabled for the API Gateway endpoint.

By providing a valid client certificate, clients must present this certificate and undergo a mutual authentication process to establish a secure connection with the API Gateway endpoint, enhancing the overall security of the system.
