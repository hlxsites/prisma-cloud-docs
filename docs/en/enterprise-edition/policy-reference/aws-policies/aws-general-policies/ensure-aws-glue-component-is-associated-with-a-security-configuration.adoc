=== Description 

This policy ensures that AWS Glue components (Crawlers, DevEndpoints, and Jobs) have a security configuration associated. Associating a security configuration with Glue components helps ensure the security of data in transit and at rest, which is critical for maintaining data integrity and protecting sensitive information. This policy checks whether the `CrawlerSecurityConfiguration` or `SecurityConfiguration` property is configured appropriately for Glue components.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*

To fix this issue, ensure that the `security_configuration` property in the `aws_glue_crawler`, `aws_glue_dev_endpoint`, and `aws_glue_job` resources is set to a valid security configuration.

Example for a Glue Crawler:

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_glue_crawler" "example" {
  ...
  security_configuration = "example-security-configuration"
  ...
}
----

Example for a Glue DevEndpoint:

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_glue_dev_endpoint" "example" {
  ...
  security_configuration = "example-security-configuration"
  ...
}
----

Example for a Glue Job:

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_glue_job" "example" {
  ...
  security_configuration = "example-security-configuration"
  ...
}
----

*CloudFormation*

To fix this issue, ensure that the appropriate security configuration properties are set for your Glue components.

Example for a Glue Crawler:

[source,yaml]
----
Resources:
  MyGlueCrawler:
    Type: AWS::Glue::Crawler
    Properties:
      Name: example-crawler
      Role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/glue-role
      DatabaseName: example-database
      Targets:
        ...
      CrawlerSecurityConfiguration: example-security-configuration
      ...
----

Example for a Glue DevEndpoint:

[source,yaml]
----
Resources:
  MyGlueDevEndpoint:
    Type: AWS::Glue::DevEndpoint
    Properties:
      EndpointName: example-dev-endpoint
      RoleArn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/glue-role
      SecurityConfiguration: example-security-configuration
      ...
----

Example for a Glue Job:


[source,yaml]
----
Resources:
  MyGlueJob:
    Type: AWS::Glue::Job
    Properties:
      Name: example-job
      Role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/glue-role
      Command:
        ...
      SecurityConfiguration: example-security-configuration
      ...
