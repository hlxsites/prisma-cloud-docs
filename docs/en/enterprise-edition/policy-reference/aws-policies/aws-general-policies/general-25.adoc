=== Description 

This policy identifies AWS Redshift instances which are not encrypted. These instances should be encrypted for clusters to help protect data at rest which otherwise can result in a data breach.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*

In order to mitigate this issue, ensure `encrypted` is set to `true`.

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "redshift" {
  ...
  cluster_identifier        = "shifty"
+ encrypted                 = true
  kms_key_id                = var.kms_key_id
  ...
}
----


*CloudFormation* 


* *Resource:* AWS::Redshift::Cluster
* *Arguments:* Properties.Encrypted

In order to mitigate this issue, ensure that `Encrypted` is set to `true`.
