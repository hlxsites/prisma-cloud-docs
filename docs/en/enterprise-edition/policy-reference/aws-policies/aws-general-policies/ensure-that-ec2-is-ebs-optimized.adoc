=== Description 


Ensuring that EC2 instances are EBS-optimized will help to deliver enhanced performance for EBS workloads.
They provide dedicated throughput to Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, which can result in improved EBS performance.
Additionally, EBS-optimized instances use a separate network connection for EBS traffic, which can reduce network latency and improve the performance of EBS-intensive workloads.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_instance
* *Arguments:* ebs_optimized


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_instance" "foo" {
  ...
+ ebs_optimized = true
}
----

*Ansible*


[source,yaml]
----
- name: Launch an EBS-Optimized EC2 instance
  amazon.aws.ec2_instance:
    name: my_ec2_instance
    image_id: ami-123456
    instance_type: t2.micro
+    ebs_optimized: yes
