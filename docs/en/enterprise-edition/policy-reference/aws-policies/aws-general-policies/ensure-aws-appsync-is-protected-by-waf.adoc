=== Description

Ensuring that your AWS AppSync API is protected by a Web Application Firewall (WAF) can help to improve the security of your API by protecting against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by inspecting incoming requests and blocking those that contain malicious payloads.
It can also help to prevent DDoS attacks by allowing you to set rate-based rules that limit the number of requests that an IP address can send to your API within a specified time period.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


To mitigate this issue, ensure that `aws_appsync_graphql_api` are connected with `aws_wafv2_web_acl_association` resources.

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_appsync_graphql_api" "pass" {
  authentication_type = "API_KEY"
  name                = "example"
}

resource "aws_wafv2_web_acl_association" "pass" {
  resource_arn = aws_appsync_graphql_api.pass.arn
  web_acl_arn  = aws_wafv2_web_acl.example.arn
}
----

To fix this issue, ensure that your AWS AppSync GraphQL API is associated with an AWS WAFv2 WebACL. You can use the `AWS::WAFv2::WebACLAssociation` resource to create this association.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
Resources:
    GoodAppSyncGraphQLApi:
        Type: "AWS::AppSync::GraphQLApi"
        Properties:
            ...
    GoodWAFv2WebACL:
        Type: "AWS::WAFv2::WebACL"
        Properties:
            ...
    WebACLAssociation:
      Type: AWS::WAFv2::WebACLAssociation
      Properties:
        ResourceArn: !GetAtt GoodAppSyncGraphQLApi.Arn
        WebACLArn: !GetAtt GoodWAFv2WebACL.Arn
