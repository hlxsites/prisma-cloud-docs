=== Description

This policy checks whether the Simple Email Service (SES) Configuration configured in AWS enforces Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS plays a crucial role in safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data, especially in emails. Not enforcing TLS can potentially expose data to risks such as interception and manipulation.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_ses_configuration_set
* *Arguments:* delivery_options.tls_policy

To fix this issue, modify your AWS Simple Email Service (SES) configurations to ensure the enforcement of Transport Layer Security (TLS) usage.

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_ses_configuration_set" "example" {
  ...

  delivery_options {
    tls_policy = "Require"
  }
}
----

The revised Terraform code above implements TLS enforcement in the SES configuration set, guaranteeing secure transmission for all outgoing emails. By setting `tls_policy` to `"Require"`, AWS SES will only deliver emails through connections encrypted with TLS. Any attempt to deliver emails over unencrypted SSL/TLS connections will be rejected.
