=== Description

If a SageMaker notebook instance is not launched into a custom VPC, it might be exposed to security vulnerabilities. This exposure could arise from traffic not being restricted to a confined, secure environment. An instance launched outside of a custom VPC might also be at risk of unwanted access from unknown entities, which could lead to potential data breaches or unauthorized changes. 

Therefore, launching instances into a custom VPC helps in the prevention of unauthorized access, minimizes attack surface, and provides a more secure and controlled environment. It helps safeguard valuable data and promotes safe business practices.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_sagemaker_notebook_instance
* *Arguments:* subnet_id

To fix this issue, you need to specify a `subnet_id` to create your SageMaker Notebook instance within a pre-defined VPC. Here is an example:

[source,hcl]
----
resource "aws_sagemaker_notebook_instance" "notebook" {
  name          = "notebook"
  role_arn      = aws_iam_role.role.arn
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.example.id  # This launches it within a custom VPC
  instance_type = "ml.t2.medium"

  lifecycle_config_name = aws_sagemaker_notebook_instance_lifecycle_configuration.lifecycle_configuration.name
}
