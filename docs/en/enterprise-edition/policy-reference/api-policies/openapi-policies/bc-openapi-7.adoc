=== Description

This policy is checking to ensure that the path scheme of the application programming interface (API) does not support unencrypted HTTP connections. An unencrypted HTTP connection means that all data transmitted between the user and the website is sent in plaintext, which can be easily intercepted and read by third parties. This presents a significant security risk as sensitive data like personal information, passwords, credit card details, etc., could be exposed and exploited. Thus, it's extremely important to use encrypted connections, like HTTPS, to secure data in transit and protect against possible attacks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*OpenAPI*

To fix the issue, you should ensure that your API supports only HTTPS connections and not HTTP. This can be done by defining the 'schemes' parameter in your OpenAPI definition to only contain 'https'. 

[source,yaml]

----

The above code is secure as it ensures all data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted. It uses the 'https' scheme for the API, which means all the data to and from the server is sent over an encrypted HTTP connection. This is important as it prevents potential attackers from intercepting or tampering with the data.
