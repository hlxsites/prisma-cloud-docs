=== Description

This policy identifies instances in JavaScript where JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are decoded or processed without proper verification of the token's signature.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,javascript]
----
let jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
let decoded = jwt.decode(token);
----

The above code is vulnerable to cryptographic failures as it improperly verifies the cryptographic signature of the JSON Web Token. This could potentially result in JWT signature verification bypass.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, replace the "decode" function with the "verify" function, which accurately handles the verification of the token's signature.



Secure code example:

[source,javascript]
----
let jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
let verified = jwt.verify(token, secret);
----

In the above example, the code is now secure, as it properly verifies the cryptographic signature of the JSON Web Token, effectively preventing JWT signature verification bypass.
