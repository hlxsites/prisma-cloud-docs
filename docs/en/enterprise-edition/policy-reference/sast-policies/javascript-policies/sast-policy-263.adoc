=== Description

This policy checks whether the Polyfill.io library is used in JavaScript applications. Polyfill.io has a history of serving malware; therefore, using the polyfill-library is strongly discouraged.

In the following code snippet, the application imports the `polyfill-library`, which is considered risky due to its history of serving malware.

[source,JavaScript]
----
import polyfill from 'polyfill-library';

function main() {
    // Risky usage of Polyfill.io library
    polyfill();
}
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, avoid using the `polyfill-library`. Consider alternative libraries or methods that do not pose a security risk.
