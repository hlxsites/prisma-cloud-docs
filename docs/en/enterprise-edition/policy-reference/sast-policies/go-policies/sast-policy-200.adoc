=== Description

This policy identifies instances where RSA keys with less than 2048 bits are generated using the `crypto/rsa` package in Go applications. RSA keys with less than 2048 bits are considered insecure due to their inadequate encryption strength. It is recommended to use RSA keys with at least 2048 bits to ensure sufficient security.

In this example, the provided code generates a vulnerable RSA key due to its insufficient 2048-bit key length.

[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "crypto/rand"
    "crypto/rsa"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Insecure RSA key generation with less than 2048 bits
    key, err := rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, 1024)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    log.Println("Generated RSA key with 1024 bits:", key)
}
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, generate RSA keys with at least 2048 bits. This ensures adequate encryption strength and security.

In this example, the application generates an RSA key with 2048 bits.

[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "crypto/rand"
    "crypto/rsa"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Secure RSA key generation with 2048 bits
    key, err := rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, 2048)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    log.Println("Generated RSA key with 2048 bits:", key)
}
