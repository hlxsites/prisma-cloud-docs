=== Description

This policy detects whether Go applications set excessive file permissions using os.Chmod, os.OpenFile, or os.WriteFile. Permissions greater than 0640 can potentially expose files to unauthorized access.

In the following example, the application sets overly permissive file permissions using os.Chmod with a mask greater than 0640. This potentially exposes the file to unauthorized access.


[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "os"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Insecure file permissions
    err := os.Chmod("/path/to/file", 0666)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, implement strict permissions for modifying files. This prevents unauthorized access by limiting access to only the necessary users. It is recommended to use `0200` for write-only access, `0400` for read-only access, or `0600` for read/write access by the application user only.

In this example, the application sets the file permissions to `0600`, ensuring that only the application user has access.

[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "os"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Secure file permissions
    err := os.Chmod("/path/to/file", 0600)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
