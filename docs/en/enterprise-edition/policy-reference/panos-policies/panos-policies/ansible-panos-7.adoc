=== Description

This policy detects whether security rules in Palo Alto Networks devices use 'any' for both 'source_ip' and 'destination_ip' simultaneously. Configuring both source and destination IPs to 'any' in a security rule can lead to overly broad permissions, potentially exposing the network to unintended traffic. At least one of these attributes, either source_ip or destination_ip, should be set to a specific value other than 'any' to enforce more granular and secure traffic filtering.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Palo Alto Networks*

* *Resource:* panos_security_rule
* *Attributes:* source_ip, destination_ip

To mitigate this risk, ensure that either the source_ip or destination_ip (or both) attributes in your panos_security_rule resources are configured with specific IP addresses or ranges instead of using any. This approach helps define precise and secure network traffic rules.

Secure Code Example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Example
  tasks:
    - name: Example
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_security_rule:
        name: "example-rule"
-        source_ip: ['any']
-        destination_ip: ['any']
+        source_ip: ['192.168.1.0/24']
+        destination_ip: ['10.1.2.0/24']
----

In this example, specifying exact IP addresses or ranges for source_ip and destination_ip ensures that the security rule does not unintentionally permit all traffic.
