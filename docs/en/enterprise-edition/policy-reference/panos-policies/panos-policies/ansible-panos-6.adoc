=== Description

This policy detects whether security rules in Palo Alto Networks devices use the 'any' setting for the service attribute instead of specifying a particular service. Setting the 'service' attribute to 'any' can create overly permissive rules, potentially allowing uncontrolled or blocked traffic. On the other hand, configuring a specific value results in tighter control and specificity in traffic management.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Palo Alto Networks*

* *Resource:* panos_security_rule
* *Attribute:* service

To mitigate this issue, define specific services in security rules to enforce the intended access controls and enhance the overall security posture. Specify the service attribute in your panos_security_rule resources with exact service definitions, avoiding the use of any.

Secure Code Example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Example
  ...
  tasks:
    - name: Example
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_security_rule:
        ...
        application: ['ssl']
-        service: ['any'] # Service is any
+        service: ['http', 'https']
----

In this example, defining the service attribute with precise values instead of 'any' ensures more granular and secure control of the network traffic.
