=== Description

This policy detects whether logging at the start of a session is enabled on Palo Alto Networks devices. While logging at session start can provide detailed insights for troubleshooting or monitoring specific long-lived GRE tunnel connections, it typically generates a large volume of logs and can lead to resource consumption issues.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Palo Alto Networks*

* *Resource:* panos_security_rule
* *Attribute:* log_start

To mitigate this risk, ensure that the `log_start` attribute is either not set (defaulting to 'false') or explicitly set to 'false' in your panos_security_rule resources. This should be the standard practice unless there is a clear, documented need to enable start-of-session logging for troubleshooting or monitoring specific scenarios.

Secure Code Example:

[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: Example
  ...
  tasks:
    - name: Example
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_security_rule:
        provider: '{{ provider }}'
        rule_name: 'Test rule'
        source_zone: ['inside']
        destination_zone: ['outside']
        source_ip: ['10.10.10.1']
        category: ['any']
        application: ['ssl']
        service: ['service-http', 'service-https']
        description: "A nice rule"
        action: 'allow'
        log_setting: 'default'
        # log_start not specified, default is true which is a pass
----

In this example, by ensuring `log_start` is set to false or is absent, you ensure that ogging at the start of a session is disabled on Palo Alto Networks devices, optimizing log management while still allowing for exceptions in scenarios where start-of-session logging is necessary.
