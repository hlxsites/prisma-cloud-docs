=== Description

This policy is checking to ensure that a Kubernetes engine cluster is configured with Network Security Group(s), or NSG(s). Failure to do so can greatly increase the security risk. NSGs offer an additional layer of security, acting as a firewall at the subnet level, controlling ingress and egress by defining rules based on the source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Without an NSG, a Kubernetes cluster could be more vulnerable to network attacks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* oci_containerengine_cluster
* *Arguments:* endpoint_config.nsg_ids

To address this issue, you should associate a Network Security Group (NSG) with the cluster's subnet. An NSG contains a list of access control lists (ACLs) that allow or deny traffic to subnets or network interfaces.
