=== Description 

This policy ensures that Alibaba Cloud Application Load Balancer (ALB) ACL (Access Control List) entries do not allow unrestricted access (i.e., `0.0.0.0/0`). Allowing unrestricted access can expose your load balancer to the entire internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential attacks.

Configuring ACL entries to restrict access helps protect the ALB from exposure to malicious traffic and ensures that only trusted IP ranges can access the resources behind the load balancer.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* alicloud_alb_acl_entry_attachment
* *Attribute:* entry

To mitigate this issue, ensure that the `entry` attribute in the `alicloud_alb_acl_entry_attachment` resource does not include `0.0.0.0/0`.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_alb_acl_entry_attachment" "example" {
  ...
  entry {
-    entry = "0.0.0.0/0"
+    entry = "192.168.1.0/24"
  }
}
----
