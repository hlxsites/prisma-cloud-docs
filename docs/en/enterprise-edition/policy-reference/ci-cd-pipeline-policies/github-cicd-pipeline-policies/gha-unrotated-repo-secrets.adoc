=== Description 

Secrets stored in your GitHub repository were not rotated for more than 180 days.

As long as a secret exists, the greater the potential for an attacker to gain access to it.
An attacker who gains access to such secrets could potentially compromise various components of your infrastructure and applications, resulting in unauthorized access and data breaches.


=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

We recommend rotating values of secrets no later than 180 days after their creation. You can do this by updating the values or deleting them and creating new ones.
