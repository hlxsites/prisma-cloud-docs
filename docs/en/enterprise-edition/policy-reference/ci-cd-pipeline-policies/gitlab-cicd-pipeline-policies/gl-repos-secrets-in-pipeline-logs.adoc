=== Description

Secrets exposed in build log files can be used by an attacker who has taken over an account with system access to move laterally throughout the organization. 

Exposed secrets can be caused by not taking the appropriate safeguards to protect credentials or by printing credentials in a manner that bypasses the featureâ€™s ability to detect credentials.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

When exposed credentials are found it is recommended to:

* Rotate all exposed credentials
* Mask GitLab CI variables that are designated as secrets
* The variables masking feature have limitations. Therefore, some exposed credentials should be resolved by modifying the pipeline manifest to prevent exposure
