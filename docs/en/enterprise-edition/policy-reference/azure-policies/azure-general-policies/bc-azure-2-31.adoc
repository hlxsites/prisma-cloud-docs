=== Description

This policy checks whether a Virtual Network (VNET) subnet in the Azure environment is configured with a Network Security Group (NSG). The NSG includes rules to allow or deny traffic to a subnet, providing security for the VNET. If a subnet is not associated with an NSG, it may be exposed to potential cybersecurity threats. Therefore, not having a NSG for a VNET subnet is considered a security risk.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_subnet, azurerm_network_security_group, azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association
* *Arguments:* name, subnet_id

To fix this issue, you need to associate your Azure Virtual Network (VNet) subnet with a Network Security Group (NSG).

----
resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "example" {
  name                = "example-nsg"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association" "example" {
  subnet_id                 = azurerm_subnet.example.id
  network_security_group_id = azurerm_network_security_group.example.id
}
----
The above configuration shows how to create an NSG and attach it to a subnet. Applying policies via Network Security Groups helps to restrict inbound, outbound traffic that is operating to and from resources connected to Azure VNets.

By associating an NSG to a subnet, you define rules for inbound and outbound traffic. This improves security by ensuring that only allowed traffic is permitted into and out of the subnet.
