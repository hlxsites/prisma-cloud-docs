=== Description

A Samsara API Key is a critical component for authenticating and authorizing access to Samsara's cloud-based services, enabling seamless integration and interaction with Samsara's extensive range of IoT solutions. These solutions encompass vehicle telematics, driver safety, mobile workflow, compliance, asset tracking, and operational insights. The API key acts as a secure token, ensuring that only authorized devices, applications, or services can access the Samsara API, thereby protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the data exchanged.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Samsara*

If your Samsara API key is exposed, take immediate action to prevent further use by regenerating a new key through your Samsara account. Replace the compromised key in all your applications and services with the newly generated one. This will ensure continued functionality while mitigating the security risks associated with the exposed key.

1. Access your account on the Samsara dashboard using your credentials.

2. Navigate to the settings or configuration section of your dashboard, and locate the API access or integration settings.

3. Look for the option to manage your API keys. Use the functionality provided to invalidate the compromised API key and generate a new one.

4. Replace the compromised API key in your application or service with the new API key provided using a secure method that does not include hard coding the key in your code.

After replacing the API key, it's advisable to review the access logs and usage patterns to identify any unauthorized access or suspicious activities. This can help in understanding the impact of the exposure and in strengthening security measures.

By taking action to regenerate a compromised Samsara API Key and updating your systems, you effectively mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to your Samsara services. Regularly monitoring and managing API keys are crucial steps in maintaining the security of your integration with Samsara's platform. For detailed procedures and best practices, always refer to the latest Samsara documentation and support resources.
