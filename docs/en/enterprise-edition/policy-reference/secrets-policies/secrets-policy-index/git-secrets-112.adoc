=== Description

An Azure Functions HTTP Trigger Key is crucial for securing HTTP-triggered Azure Functions, restricting access to authorized clients. This key is essential for preventing unauthorized data exposure and manipulation through the function. Securely managing this key is imperative to maintain the integrity and security of applications relying on Azure Functions. Regular checks and updates of your security settings and keys are crucial for maintaining a robust security posture. For more detailed security practices and guidance, refer to the latest https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger?tabs=python-v2%2Cisolated-process%2Cnodejs-v4%2Cfunctionsv2&pivots=programming-language-csharp[Azure documentation and support] resources.

*Azure*

If your Azure Functions HTTP Trigger Key is exposed, it's crucial to take immediate action to revoke the old key and generate a new one in order to secure access to the function. By replacing the exposed key and updating all applications accordingly, you effectively safeguard your Azure Function from unauthorized access.

1. Log into your Azure Portal using your administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the relevant Azure Functions application.

3. Access the 'Function keys' section within the platform features of the Azure Functions application.


4. Delete the exposed key and generate a new one by selecting '+ New key'. Provide a name for the new key and save the changes.

5. Update all applications and services using this key with the new key values, ensuring the new key is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Azure Functions HTTP Trigger Key to check for any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the security impact of the exposure and improve your protective measures.
