=== Description

The Stripe Webhook Secret is a critical credential used to verify the integrity and authenticity of webhook events sent by Stripe to your server. It ensures that the events are genuinely from Stripe and have not been tampered with. Exposing this secret can lead to unauthorized access and potential misuse of your Stripe account, including the manipulation of transactions and financial data. To maintain the security of your Stripe integration, it is essential to manage your Webhook Secret securely and regularly review your security practices to prevent any unauthorized usage. For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding Stripe Webhook Secret management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures[Stripe documentation and support].

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Stripe*

If your Stripe Webhook Secret is exposed, it's crucial to take immediate action to prevent any unauthorized use. Regenerate a new secret through your Stripe account and replace the exposed secret with the new secret in all relevant applications. By regenerating a compromised Stripe Webhook Secret and updating your application integrations, you not only secure your Stripe webhook events but also maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your financial transactions.

1. Log into your Stripe account with administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=%2Fwebhooks[dashboard section] and select 'Webhooks'.

3. Identify the affected webhook endpoint and delete the compromised secret.
NOTE: Ensure that deleting your secret does not disrupt any transactions or services.

4. Add a new webhook endpoint to generate a new secret.

5. Update all applications and services that use the Stripe Webhook Secret with the new secret values, ensuring the new secret is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the secret, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Stripe Webhook Secret to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
