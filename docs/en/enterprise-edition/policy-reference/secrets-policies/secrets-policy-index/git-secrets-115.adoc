=== Description

The Azure Machine Learning web service API Key serves as an essential credential for accessing Azure Machine Learning web services. This key acts as a security measure, guaranteeing that only authorized applications can interact with the API and utilize the services provided. Exposing the API key can lead to unauthorized access, misuse of the API, and potential data leaks. For this reason, it's crucial to manage your Azure Machine Learning web service API Key securely and regularly review your security practices to prevent any unauthorized usage.

For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding Azure Machine Learning web service API Key management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-defn-azure-machine-learning-web-service-api-key[Azure Machine Learning documentation and support] resources.

If your Azure Machine Learning web service API key is exposed, it's crucial to take immediate action to prevent any unauthorized use. Regenerate a new key through your Azure account and replace the exposed key with the new key in all relevant applications. By regenerating a compromised Azure Machine Learning web service API Key and updating your application integrations, you not only secure your access to Azure Machine Learning web services but also maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your data flows.

1. Log into your Azure Portal with administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the relevant Azure Machine Learning workspace.

3. Access the 'Keys' section within the Azure Machine Learning service.

4. Identify the exposed key and delete it.
NOTE: Ensure that deleting your key does not break any applications.

5. Select 'Create new key' to generate a new API Key. Provide a name for the new key and save the changes.

6. Update all applications and services using this key with the new key values, ensuring the new key is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Azure Machine Learning web service API key to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
