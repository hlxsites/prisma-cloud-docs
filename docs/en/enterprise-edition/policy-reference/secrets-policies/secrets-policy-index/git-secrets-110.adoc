*Hugging Face*

If your Hugging Face token is exposed, it's crucial to take immediate action to prevent any unauthorized use. Regenerate a new key through your Hugging Face account and replace the exposed token with the new token in all relevant applications. By taking prompt action, you not only secure your access to Hugging Face's AI services but also maintain the confidentiality and privacy of your integrations.

1. Sign in to your Hugging Face account.

2. Navigate to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens.

3. Locate the exposed secret, and select Manage > Invalidate and refresh the token.

After updating the token, it is recommended to audit access logs and check for any abnormal or unauthorized usage patterns. This analysis will help assess any potential data breaches or security threats and aid in further fortifying your security posture.
