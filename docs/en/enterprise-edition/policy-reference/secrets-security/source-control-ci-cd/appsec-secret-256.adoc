=== Description

The Rails Master Key is a highly sensitive credential used in Ruby on Rails applications for encrypting sensitive data, such as session cookies and database credentials. Exposure of this key could allow attackers to decrypt sensitive information, hijack user sessions, or gain unauthorized access to your application and its data. Reference the https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html[Ruby on Rails documentation] for more details.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Rails*

To mitigate the risks associated with exposed Rails Master Keys, follow these steps:

1. Generate a new master key by running `rails credentials:edit` in your Rails project root. This will create a new `config/master.key` if it doesn't exist. Alternatively, you can manually create a new key using `EDITOR="vim" bin/rails credentials:edit`.

2. Update your environment with the new key. Replace any environment variables or infrastructure configurations that reference the previous key, updating secrets management on your hosting provider as well.

3. Remove the old key from your local setup and in any environment variables to prevent unauthorized access. If the `master.key` was committed to version control, scrub the history using Git commands or tools like `BFG Repo-Cleaner`.

4. Test the new configuration by deploying your changes to confirm that your Rails application can access the credentials with the new key. 

Monitor your logs for suspicious behavior.
