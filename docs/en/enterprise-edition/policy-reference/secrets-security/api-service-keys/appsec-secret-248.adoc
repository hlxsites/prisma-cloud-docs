=== Description

A Sourcegraph access token grants programmatic access to your Sourcegraph instance. Exposing this token could compromise your codebase and other sensitive information, potentially enabling unauthorized actions like reading code, managing settings, or accessing user data.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Sourcegraph*

To address an exposed Sourcegraph access token, follow the following steps:

1. Immediately revoke the compromised token from your Sourcegraph user settings. 
2. Create a new access token with the least privileges necessary for the intended application or workflow.
3. Monitor your account for abuse.

IMPORTANT: Regularly review and rotate access tokens, especially after security incidents or personnel changes, to minimize the impact of potential exposures.
