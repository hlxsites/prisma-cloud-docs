=== Description

Terraform modules are a collection of multiple resource configuration to offer an easy way of repeatable and reusable code logic.
The most common way is to consume them through the public Terraform registry, which are connected to a VCS, like GitHub.
This approach is problematic, because the module versions are not immutable and the module can be changed without changing the version, which makes the code vulnerable to a Supply Chain Attack.
To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use Git URLs with a commit hash revision to guarantee immutability and consistency. Although Git tags can also be used, they are not as immutable as a hash and are therefore less preferred. This policy is a less restrictive version of the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/policy-reference/supply-chain-policies/terraform-policies/ensure-terraform-module-sources-use-git-url-with-commit-hash-revision[Terraform module sources do not use a git url with a commit hash revision] policy that only allows for hashes.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*


* *Resource: module*
* *Argument: source, condition*

If you are using a remote module, use the Git URL with a git tag or commit hash.

[source,go]
----
module "vpc" {
- source = "git::https://github.com/example/module"
+ source = "git::https://github.com/example/module.git?ref=mytag-1.0.0"  # commit tag

  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b", "eu-west-1c"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway = true
  enable_vpn_gateway = true

  tags = {
    Terraform = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
