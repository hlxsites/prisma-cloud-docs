=== Description

This policy checks whether Azure Storage Accounts for Machine Learning workspaces are publicly accessible. Public access to these accounts storing sensitive business data poses a significant security risk. Leaks or misuse could lead to financial and reputational damage. By ensuring private access, this policy safeguards data confidentiality and integrity.
