=== Description 

This policy ensures that Alibaba Cloud OSS (Object Storage Service) buckets are encrypted using a Customer Master Key (CMK). Encrypting buckets with a CMK enhances data security by providing granular control over key management, including key rotation, access policies, and auditing.

Failing to use a CMK for encryption can increase the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data and make it harder to meet compliance and security requirements.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

* *Resource:* alicloud_oss_bucket
* *Arguments:* server_side_encryption_rule.kms_master_key_id

To mitigate this issue, ensure the `server_side_encryption_rule.kms_master_key_id` attribute is configured with a valid CMK ID in the `alicloud_oss_bucket` resource.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_oss_bucket" "example" {
  ...
  server_side_encryption_rule {
+    kms_master_key_id = "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab" # Replace with your CMK ID
  }
}
