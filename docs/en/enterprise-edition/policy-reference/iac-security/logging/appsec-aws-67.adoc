=== Description 

This policy identifies the AWS accounts which do not have a CloudTrail with multi trail enabled and capturing all management events. AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational & risk auditing of the AWS account. It is a compliance and security best practice to turn on CloudTrail across different regions to get a complete audit trail of activities across various services.

NOTE: If you have Organization Trail enabled in your account, this policy can be disabled, or alerts generated for this policy on such an account can be ignored; as Organization Trail by default enables trail log for all accounts under that organization.
