=== Description

This policy checks if Elasticsearch/OpenSearch clusters are configured with a dedicated master node. Having a dedicated master node for Elasticsearch/OpenSearch clusters helps ensure that the clusterâ€™s state and health status is managed properly and prevents the cluster from becoming unstable in case of failures.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* aws_opensearch_domain, aws_elasticsearch_domain
* *Arguments:* cluster_config.dedicated_master_enabled

To fix the issue, ensure the 'dedicated_master_enabled' configuration is set to 'true' inside the 'cluster_config' block of the Elasticsearch or OpenSearch domain resource.

Secure code example:

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_elasticsearch_domain" "example" {
  domain_name = "example"

  cluster_config {
    instance_count = 5
+   dedicated_master_enabled = true
    dedicated_master_type = "m3.medium.elasticsearch"
  }
}
----

The above code is secure as it enables a dedicated master node in the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch domain, which provides better control and stability over the cluster's state and health status.
