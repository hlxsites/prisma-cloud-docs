=== Description

Allowing public access is generally a bad practice in security terms, as it can potentially expose sensitive data or functionality. Without proper access controls in place, unauthorized users could potentially gain access to secure areas, manipulate data, invoke functions, or even take control of the system or resources. This policy ensures that public access is not permitted, thereby maintaining a tighter control over who can interact with the system.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* google_iam_policy
* *Arguments:* binding

Instead of using 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' which grants permissions to any user on the internet, specific user, role, or service account should be given permissions.

[source,go]
----
resource "google_project_iam_policy" "project" {
  project     = "your-project-id"
  policy_data = "${data.google_iam_policy.admin.policy_data}"
}

data "google_iam_policy" "admin" {
  binding {
    role = "roles/storage.objectViewer"

    members = [
      "user:individual-email",
      "serviceAccount:service-account-email",
    ]
  }
}
----

This code allows only the specified users and service account to get 'objectViewer' permissions. Making such changes to your IAM policies will keep your resources secure by preventing unauthorized access. This adheres to the policy of ensuring IAM policy does not define public access.
