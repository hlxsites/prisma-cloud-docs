=== Description

This policy is verifying that Big Table Instances operated within Google Cloud Platform (GCP) have deletion protection enabled. The purpose of this check is to prevent unintended data loss or service disruption from the accidental deletion of important Big Table Instances. If deletion protection is not enabled, an erroneous delete command could lead to permanent loss of data or service functionality, affecting business operations or possibly leading to a breach in compliance obligations.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* google_bigtable_instance
* *Arguments:* deletion_protection

To fix this issue, enable deletion protection on BigTable Instances in your terraform configuration file.

[source,go]
```
resource "google_bigtable_instance" "instance" {
  deletion_protection = true
  ...
}
```

The code above is considered secure because `deletion_protection` is set to `true`. When `deletion_protection` is enabled, this ensures that accidental deletion of the instance is prevented because the instance cannot be deleted when `deletion_protection` is set to `true`. This is a security best practice that adds an additional layer of protection to prevent data loss.
