=== Description

This policy is examining whether a Vertex AI feature store is using a Customer Managed Key (CMK) for encryption. It is highly important to follow this policy because using a CMK provides greater control over the keys used for encryption. If a default key is used, it could potentially be more vulnerable to certain types of risks such as unauthorized access. With a Customer Managed Key, the user has complete control over the key's rotation, disablement, and deletion, which significantly improves data security.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* google_vertex_ai_featurestore
* *Arguments:* encryption_spec

To fix this issue, you need to designate a Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) for your GCP Vertex AI feature store. You can do this by specifying the "encryption_spec" block and pointing to your Customer-Managed Key in your terraform resource for the feature store.

[source,go]
----
data "google_vertex_ai_featurestore" "example" {
  ...
  encryption_spec {
    kms_key_name = "some_name"
  }
  ...
}
----

The updated Terraform code now includes the "encryption_spec" configuration, which is set to utilize a Customer-Managed Encryption Key. Now, the feature store data is encrypted using the customer-managed key which enhances the security of sensitive data, as the customer has direct control over key management activities.
