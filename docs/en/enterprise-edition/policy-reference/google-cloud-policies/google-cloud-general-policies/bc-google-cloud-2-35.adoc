=== Description

This policy's function is to assure that the runtime for Vertex AI, a Google Cloud service focused on machine learning, is encrypted using a Customer Managed Key, or CMK, rather than a default or auto-generated key.

The lack of such encryption could expose data to security threats. A CMK offers an additional protection layer, since the customer fully manages the key's rotation, revocation, and audit logging. If one doesn't use a CMK, control over these elements is lost, increasing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* google_notebooks_runtime
* *Arguments:* virtual_machine.virtual_machine_config.encryption_config.kms_key

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the Vertex AI runtime is set to be encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK).

[source,go]
----
resource "google_notebooks_runtime" "example" {
  ...
  virtual_machine {
    virtual_machine_config {
      encryption_config {
        kms_key = "an-actual-key"
      }
      ...
    }
  }
}

In general, managing keys on your own adds an extra layer of security to your applications. It also gives you more control over how and when those keys are used and retired.
