=== Description

This policy detects whether API key creation is unrestricted in account settings. Unrestricted API key creation can increase the risk of unauthorized access. By restricting creation, you can better control who has access to your resources, minimizing the potential for keys to be created without oversight, and mitigate the risk of malicious use.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* ibm_iam_account_settings
* *Arguments:* restrict_create_platform_apikey

Ensure that API key creation is restricted to authorized processes and users by setting the `restrict_create_platform_apikey` attribute to `RESTRICTED` in account settings. This helps prevent unauthorized access to IBM Cloud resources.

In this example, the `restrict_create_platform_apikey` attribute is set to `RESTRICTED` in the `ibm_iam_account_settings` resource to restrict API key creation.

[source,go]
----
resource "ibm_iam_account_settings" "example" {
  ...
  restrict_create_platform_apikey = "RESTRICTED"  # Restricts API key creation
}
