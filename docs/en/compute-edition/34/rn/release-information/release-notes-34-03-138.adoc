[#upgrade]
=== Upgrade from Previous Releases

[#upgrade-defender]
==== Upgrade Defenders

With the `v34.00` release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/34/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported Defender releases (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v34`, `v33`, and `v32` respectively. In addition, Prisma Cloud will not restrict the usage of Defender versions or REST API calls from the n-3 releases. So, the current release will allow Defenders and REST API calls from release `v31` also. Failure to upgrade Defenders below release `v31`, such as `v30.03`, will result in disconnection of the Defenders from the Console.

However, to maintain full support, you must upgrade your Defenders to a `v32.xx` or later release.

To summarize, the level of support for the different versions of Defenders is as follows:

* Defender versions 34.xx, 33.xx, and 32.xx have full support
* Defender versions 31.xx are functional (will be able to connect to version 34.00 Console) but support is not available for such Defenders
* Defender versions previous to 31.00, such as 30.03, are neither supported nor functional (cannot connect to version 34.xx Console)


[#upgrade-console]
==== Upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console

With the `v34.00` release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/34/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported Console releases (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v34`, `v33`, and `v32` respectively. 

NOTE: Defenders from the n-3 release will remain functional as described above. 

You can upgrade the Prisma Cloud console directly from any n-1 or n-2 version to n. For example, with `v34` as n and `v33` as n-1, you can upgrade directly from `33.01.137` to `34.00.141`. You can also upgrade directly from an n-2 version (`32.00.161`, `32.01.128`, `32.02.127`, `32.03.123`, `32.04.113`, `32.05.124`, `32.06.113`, `32.07.123`) to `34.00.141`.

[cols="30%a,70%a"]

|*Feature*
|*Description*


|*Enhanced Alma Linux vulnerability assessment*

// CWP-63936

|Vulnerability assessments for Alma Linux are significantly improved due to the integration of CVEs from Alma Linux security advisories (currently, for releases 8 and 9) into the Intelligence Stream. This enhancement provides a more comprehensive and accurate picture of security risks, ultimately improving the security of Alma Linux 8 and 9 systems. 


|*Support for RHEL 10*

// CWP-63973

|This release includes full support for RedHat Enterprise Linux 10. 


|*NVD score utilization and impact*

// CWP-64072

|NVD traditionally provides two scores: a primary score from NIST and a secondary score from other sources. Previously, the secondary score was not used, even when the primary score was unavailable. 

*Updated behavior:*

. If the NVD primary score is missing and a CISA ADP secondary score is available, the secondary score will be used as the CVE score (for example,  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8671).

. Once the NVD primary score becomes available, it will revert to being the CVE score.

*Note:* The secondary score is used only if the primary score is not available and the secondary score is based on a CISA-ADP evaluation.

*Impact on vulnerability reporting:*

This improvement will lead to a change in how vulnerabilities are classified. Previously, vulnerabilities without a score, would be assigned a score of “0" and were categorized as "Low" severity. With this enhancement, they will now be assigned the CVSS and severity provided by CISA-ADP. This could result in an increase of up to 0.58% in the total number of reported Medium, High, or Critical vulnerabilities.



|*Collect Kubernetes Pod labels*

//CWP-63976 

|If you enable the Collect Deployment and Namespace Labels toggle while deploying a defender, an environment variable, COLLECT_POD_LABELS is set to true in the YAML file or helm chart. Orchestrator defenders that are deployed with this setting use the Kubernetes API while scanning to collect labels of the deployment and namespace resources that contain the pods hosting the containers.

This feature is enhanced to support a new environment variable, COLLECT_POD_RESOURCE_LABELS. After enabling the Collect Deployment and Namespace Labels toggle, if you add this variable and set it to true, the Orchestrator defenders also collect labels of the pod containing the container.

Together these two environment variables support the use case of accessing the labels assigned using the command: kubectl label pod.

You can view these labels in the container details tab, or retrieve them from the externalLabels and labels fields in the response of the API: 

https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cwpp/get-containers/.

|*Enhanced security coverage for CAAS containers*


//CWP-63522

|App-embedded defenders now support multi-container CaaS deployments on:

* ACI container groups

* Google Cloud Run platform 

* Amazon EKS on AWS Fargate

Support is now available for these services, augmenting the existing support for Amazon ECS Fargate. 

The enhanced support also includes:

* Account ID attribution for ACI container groups, Google Cloud Run, and AWS EKS on Fargate

* Detection of Defended/Undefended status for ACI container groups, Google Cloud Run, and EKS on Fargate


|*Enhanced support for OCI tag-based filtering*

//CWP-63568

|The tag-based filtering mechanism for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) now supports filters at the compartment level. You can now include or exclude hosts at the compartment level using this feature.
