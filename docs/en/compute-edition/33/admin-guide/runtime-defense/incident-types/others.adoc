== Other Incident Types

* *Cloud Provider:*
Indicates attempts to abuse a provider's service to extract sensitive information.
+
For example: Container `A` queried provider API at `<IP_ADDRESS>`.

* *Data Exfiltration:*
Indicates a potential compromise on a container because of a modified binary listening on a port. This typically leads with a DNS suspicious activity.
+
For example: Container process `/bin/bash` is listening on unexpected port `50000`.

* *Hijacked Process:*
Indicates that an allowed process was used in a way that is inconsistent with its expected behavior. This can be a sign that a process has been used to compromise a container.
