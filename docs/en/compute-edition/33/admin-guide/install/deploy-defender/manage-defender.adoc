=== Runtime Restart Scenarios for Defenders

You can expect a runtime restart in the following scenarios:

* When a Defender starts.

* When a Defender stops.

* When you add the first blocking rule.

* When you remove the last blocking rule.

* When a Defender upgrades because the Defender restarts.

When Defender restarts in Openshift Kubernetes clusters, nodes may become `NotReady`. The nodes come back online after the `kubelet` restart is complete.
