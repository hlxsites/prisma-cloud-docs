[#upgrade]
=== Upgrade from Previous Releases

[#upgrade-defender]
==== Upgrade Defenders

With the `v33.00` release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v33.00`, `v32.00`, and `v31.00` respectively. In addition, starting from this release (version 33.00), Prisma Cloud will not restrict the usage of Defender versions or REST API calls from the n-3 version. So the current release will allow Defenders and REST API calls from release 30.xx also. Failure to upgrade Defenders below version `v30.00`, such as `v22.12`, will result in disconnection of the Defenders from the Console.

However, to maintain full support, you must upgrade your Defenders to `v31.xx` or a higher release.

To summarize, the level of support for the different versions of Defenders is as follows:

* Defender versions 33.xx, 32.xx, and 31.xx have full support
* Defender versions 30.xx are functional (will be able to connect to version 33.xx Console) but support is not available for such Defenders
* Defender versions previous to 30.xx, such as 22.12, are neither supported nor functional (cannot connect to version 33.xx Console)


[#upgrade-console]
==== Upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console

With the `v33.00` release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported Console versions (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v33.00`, `v32.00`, and `v31.00` respectively. 

NOTE: Defenders from the n-3 release will remain functional as described above.    

You can upgrade the Prisma Cloud console directly from any n-1 version to n. With `v33.00` as n and `v32.00` as n-1, you can upgrade directly from `v32.05.124` to `v33.00.169`.

NOTE: You have to upgrade any version of `v31.00` to `v32.00` before upgrading to `v33.00`. For example, you can upgrade from `v31.02.137` to `v32.07.123` and then upgrade to `v32.00.159`.

=== Announcement


=== Lifecycle Support Update

Prisma Cloud officially guarantees backward compatibility with up to two previous major versions (n-2).

Although the support lifecycle remains unchanged, starting from version 33.xx, Prisma Cloud will not restrict the usage of Defender versions or REST API calls from up to three major releases before the current version (upto n-3 major releases).

For example, with the current version at 33.xx, API calls and Defenders from version 30.xx will be allowed. However, support and complete backward compatibility is guaranteed for the 32.xx and 31.xx releases.
