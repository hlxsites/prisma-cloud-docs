[#upgrade]
=== Upgrade from Previous Releases

[#upgrade-defender]
==== Upgrade Defender Versions 22.06 and Earlier

With the `v32.00` release, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/32/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/welcome/support_lifecycle[Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.

To prepare for this update, you must upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.06` (Kepler) or earlier to a later version.
Failure to upgrade Defenders will result in disconnection of any Defender version below `v22.12` such as `v22.06`.

[#upgrade-console]
==== Upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console

With the `v32.00` release, the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/32/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/welcome/support_lifecycle[supported Console versions (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.

You can upgrade the Prisma Cloud console directly from any version for n-1 to n.
With `v30.00` as n-1 and `v31.00` as n, you can for example go directly from `v30.01.153` to `v31.00.129`.

You have to upgrade any version of `v22.00` to `v30.00` before upgrading to `v31.00`.
For example, you can upgrade from `v22.12.693` to `v30.02.123` and then upgrade to `v32.00.159`.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

//CWP-52181
|*Agentless Scanning*
|Enabled the scan of non-running hosts by default.
Agentless scanning now scans non-running hosts by default for all newly added accounts.
This change does not affect existing accounts.

//CWP-49984
|*Registry Scanning*
|The following new fields are now displayed for registry scans:

* Scan status—if the scan completed successfully or failed.

* Last scan time—the time at which defender started scanning the registry.

A new unified scan progress indicator shows the status (percentage and number) of scanning and pending registries.

//CWP-47706
|*Vulnerability Management*
|Improved the detection of vulnerabilities on supported Windows OS workloads to fix false negative and false positive alerts related to Windows feeds.

// //CWP-55308
// |*Cloud Account Management*
// |Introduced the *Account Import Status* filter on the *Cloud Accounts* page in *Runtime Security*.
// This feature includes three statuses:

// * *Local accounts:* cloud accounts created in Runtime Security only (and not in the Prisma Cloud console)
// * *Manually imported accounts:* cloud accounts that were manually imported from Prisma Cloud console to Runtime Security in the past prior to the Lagrange release (end of 2022)
// * *Auto-imported accounts:* cloud accounts that originated from Prisma Cloud console and seamlessly imported into Runtime Security.

[cols="30%a,70%a"]
|===

//CWP-55309
| *API to list cloud accounts that are imported from the Prisma Cloud platform*
|You can onboard accounts and cloud credentials only through the Prisma Cloud platform Accounts page now. To support this change, the following new query parameters have been added to the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cwpp/get-credentials/[Get All Credentials] endpoint. These parameters allow you to list cloud accounts that are imported from the Prisma Cloud platform:

* `external`: Set to `true` to retrieve credentials imported from the Prisma Cloud platform Accounts page.
* `autoImported`: Set to `true` to retrieve credentials that were automatically imported from the Prisma Cloud platform Accounts page.


//CWP-52775
|*New request body field in the Download Serverless Layer Bundle endpoint*
|The https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cwpp/post-images-twistlock-defender-layer-zip/[Download Serverless Layer Bundle] endpoint includes a new request body field: `nodeJSModuleType`, which accepts one of these values:

* `commonjs` 
* `ecmascript` 

The `nodeJSModuleType` field is optional and the default value is `commonjs`.
