[#upgrade]
=== Upgrade from Previous Releases

[#upgrade-defender]
==== Upgrade Defender Versions

With the v32.xx release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported (n, n-1, and n-2) Defender versions] are v32.xx, v31.xx, and v30.xx. Defender versions below v30.xx such as v22.12 cannot connect to the current version.

//To prepare for this update, upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.06` (Kepler) or earlier to a later version.

==== Upcoming Defender Obsolescence

With the upcoming v33.00 release, release v30.xx defenders will be obsolete. To prepare for this upcoming update, plan to upgrade defenders to release v31.xx or later.

[#upgrade-console]
==== Upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console

With the v32.xx release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported (n, n-1, and n-2) Console versions] are v32.xx, v31.xx, and v30.xx.  For example: for the current (n) major release v32.xx, the supported n-1 and n-2 versions are v31.xx and v30.xx respectively.

You can upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console from a major release to the next major release, but not to a major release that follows the next. So, to upgrade from the v30.xx release to the v32.xx release, you will have to first upgrade to  v31.xx and then upgrade to the v32.xx release.

|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Go Symbol Extraction in Prisma Cloud*

//CWP-58813[Doc Ticket]
|When scanning Golang binaries, Prisma Cloud extracts Go symbols, which allows for evaluating vulnerabilities accurately with specific package names and symbols. The feature flag for extracting Go symbols is enabled by default.
Prisma Cloud also allows you to selectively disable symbol extraction when they are not needed, to optimize the scan.

To disable this feature, follow these steps:

* Self-hosted edition: Add the environment variable SYMBOL_EXTRACTION_ENABLED=False in the twistlock.cfg file.

* SaaS edition: Add the environment variable core-symbol-extraction-enabled=False in the Launch Darkly mode.

* Using twistcli: Add the --disable-symbol-extraction flag to the image scan command.

|*Exporting Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) files in CycloneDX version 1.4*


//CWP-58812[Doc Ticket]
|Prisma Cloud now supports https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/vulnerability-management/exporting-sboms[exporting Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) files] in CycloneDX version 1.4 for functions, images, and hosts scans. SBOM files can be generated in JSON or XML format.

*SBOM Attributes*

The SBOM files contain the following attributes:

* Name: Name of the package
* BOM-REF: Package URL (PURL) if it exists; otherwise, UUID (for applications)
* Package Version: Version number for the package
* Package Author: Applicable only for specific package types such as rpm, jem, apk, and deb
* PURL Identifier: Package URL (PURL) identifier
* License: Package license details
* Timestamp (metadata): Time of printing
* Type (metadata): Type of asset. In all the stages, images are categorized as containers, serverless functions as services, hosts and VMs as frameworks.
* Name (metadata): Asset ID of images, hosts, and functions

SBOM files can be downloaded either through API calls or twistcli.

For information about the SBOM API calls, see the link:#rest-api-changes[REST API Changes] section.

*twistcli Configuration*

* Export SBOMs using the new flag: --SBOM [file_format]

* File Format Values: cyclonedx_json or cyclonedx_xml

* SBOM output is concatenated to the scan results output. Use the --output flag to print scan results and SBOM output to a specified file.

|*Resolving method for cluster name*

//CWP-59133
|When deploying Defender to your Kubernetes cluster, Prisma Cloud now provides you the option to use the API server address from the kube config file to resolve cluster names. 

This option ensures that each cluster has a unique cluster name in Prisma Cloud.

A new field, Cluster name resolving method, has been added to the Manage → Defenders → “Manual Deploy” → Orchestrator → “Orchestrator type = Kubernetes" → Advanced Settings page.

The *Cluster name resolving method* field has the following options:

* *Default*: Allows Prisma Cloud to automatically generate the name based on available information such as kube config, resource group information, and cloud provider metadata endpoints.

* *Manual*: Enables you to set the cluster name manually. When you select this option, the "Specify a cluster name" box appears, allowing you to enter the desired name.

* *API Server*: Uses the API server address from the kube config file to generate a unique cluster name in Prisma Cloud.

This enhancement ensures that vulnerability information is accurately reported for each cluster and makes sure that the clean clusters are not misrepresented as vulnerable due to naming conflicts.
