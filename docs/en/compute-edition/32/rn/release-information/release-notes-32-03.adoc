[#upgrade]
=== Upgrade from Previous Releases

[#upgrade-defender]
==== Upgrade Defender Versions 22.06 and Earlier

With the `v32.00` release, https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.

To prepare for this update, you must upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.06` (Kepler) or earlier to a later version.
Failure to upgrade Defenders will result in disconnection of any Defender version below `v22.12` such as `v22.06`.

[#upgrade-console]
==== Upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console

With the `v32.00` release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported Console versions (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.

You can upgrade the Prisma Cloud console directly from any version for n-1 to n.
With `v30.00` as n-1 and `v31.00` as n, you can for example go directly from `v30.01.153` to `v31.00.129`.

You have to upgrade any version of `v22.00` to `v30.00` before upgrading to `v31.00`.
For example, you can upgrade from `v22.12.693` to `v30.02.123` and then upgrade to `v32.00.159`.
