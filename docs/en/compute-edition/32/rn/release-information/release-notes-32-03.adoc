[#upgrade]
=== Upgrade from Previous Releases

[#upgrade-defender]
==== Upgrade Defender Versions 22.12 and Earlier

With the `v32.00` release, https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.

To prepare for this update, you must upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.12` (Lagrange) or earlier to a later version.
Failure to upgrade Defenders will result in disconnection of any Defender version below `v30.00` such as `v22.12`.

//
==== Upcoming Defender Obsolescence

With the upcoming `v33.00` release, release `v30.xx` defenders will be obsolete. To prepare for this coming update, plan for upgrading to release `v31.xx` or later at the earliest. 

[#upgrade-console]
==== Upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console

With the `v32.00` release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported Console versions (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.

You can upgrade the Prisma Cloud console directly from any version for n-1 to n.
With `v30.00` as n-1 and `v31.00` as n, you can for example go directly from `v30.01.153` to `v31.00.129`.

You have to upgrade any version of `v22.00` to `v30.00` before upgrading to `v31.00`.
For example, you can upgrade from `v22.12.693` to `v30.02.123` and then upgrade to `v32.00.159`.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

//CWP-53557 and CWP-55790 (Doc ticket)
|*Support Amazon Linux 2023*
|Prisma Cloud now supports Amazon Linux 2023 OS scans and security feed integration for Amazon Linux 2023.

// CWP-55094
|*Enhanced CSV Organization*
|Segregating vulnerability and compliance findings based on Download Context.

//CWP-54524
|*Enhanced Compliance Report*
|Added a new *Result* column to the compliance report CSV file. To get the report, go to *Monitor > Compliance > Compliance Explorer* and select *Containers*, *Images*, or *Hosts*. The new column shows either  *pass* or *fail* for each resource and the corresponding compliance check ID.

//CWP-42824
|*Detect Go Stdlib Vulnerabilities at the Package Level*
|In O’Neal Update 3, Prisma Cloud has enhanced its capability to detect vulnerabilities in Go libraries. Previously, a broad approach was used for Go stdlib libraries, categorizing CVEs as "Go" vulnerabilities rather than associating them with specific vulnerable standard libraries. This update offers a more precise classification, allowing for the identification of specific vulnerable symbols within libraries. Moreover, the latest agents can now detect both stdlib with symbols they utilize and the installed Go runtime. This comprehensive approach enables Prisma Cloud to conduct more accurate vulnerability assessments, leading to a significant reduction in false positives. If you have utilized the Go detection capabilities previously, you are likely to experience a noticeable reduction in the number of reported vulnerabilities due to this improvement.

[#api-changes]
=== API Changes and New APIs
[cols="40%a,60%a"]
|===

// CWP-55094
|*Split Vulnerability and Compliance CSV*

|The following APIs include a new parameter, `issueType`:

* https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-hosts-download/[Download Host Scan Results]
* https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-images-download/[Download Image Scan Results]
* https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-registry-download/[Download Registry Scan Results]
* https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-scans-download/[Download CI Image Scan Results]
* https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-vms-download/[Download VM Image Scan Results]
* https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-serverless-download/[Download Serverless Function Scan Results]

The `issueType` parameter can be set to `vulnerabilities` or `compliance` for downloading vulnerability or compliance issues respectively. If either value is not provided, both vulnerability and compliance issues are downloaded.

// CWP-51234
|*"Type" field is internal only - not returned in 'vulnerabilities' API json (scan results)*

|The following APIs include a new parameter, `packageType`:

https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-containers/[Get Container Scan Results]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-hosts/[Get Host Scan Results]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/post-hosts-evaluate/[Resolve Hosts]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-images/[Get Image Scan Results]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/post-images-evaluate/[Resolve Images]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-scans/[Get All CI Image Scan Results]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/post-scans/[Add CLI Scan Result]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-serverless/[Get Serverless Function Scan Results]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/post-serverless-evaluate/[Resolve Functions]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-vms/[Get VM Image Scan Results]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/post-coderepos-ci-evaluate/[Resolve Code Repos]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/post-sandbox/[Add Sandbox Scan Result]
https://pan.dev/compute/api/get-registry/[Get Registry Scan Results]

The  ‘packageType’ field is added to the vulnerabilities schema responses.

//CWP-50513
|*New incident policies based on traffic observation*
|This update adds two new policies that alert you to traffic that includes:

* Sensitive data sent through an API endpoint that is exposed to the internet without authentication.
* Sensitive data sent through an API endpoint that is exposed to the internet without encryption.
