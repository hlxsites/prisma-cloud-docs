[#upgrade]
=== Upgrade from Previous Releases

[#upgrade-defender]
==== Upgrade Defender Versions

With the v32.xx release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported (n, n-1, and n-2) Defender versions] are v32.xx, v31.xx, and v30.xx. Defender versions below v30.xx such as v22.12 cannot connect to the current version.

//To prepare for this update, upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.06` (Kepler) or earlier to a later version.

==== Upcoming Defender Obsolescence

With the upcoming v33.00 release, release v30.xx defenders will be obsolete. To prepare for this upcoming update, plan to upgrade defenders to release v31.xx or later.

[#upgrade-console]
==== Upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console

With the v32.xx release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported (n, n-1, and n-2) Console versions] are v32.xx, v31.xx, and v30.xx.  For example: for the current (n) major release v32.xx, the supported n-1 and n-2 versions are v31.xx and v30.xx respectively.

You can upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console from a major release to the next major release, but not to a major release that follows the next. So, to upgrade from the v30.xx release to the v32.xx release, you will have to first upgrade to  v31.xx and then upgrade to the v32.xx release.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

//CWP-56798
|*Blobstore Scanning Defender Upgrade for Tanzu Customers*
|Enhanced the existing `blobstore` scanning feature for Tanzu customers. As a part of this enhancement, existing `blobstore` scanning defenders will now appear disconnected and new defender instances will be automatically created to replace them. The disconnected `blobstore` will disappear after 24 hours as part of the retention process. This upgrade excludes Linux and Windows defenders (Full coverage defenders).
If you have have configured `blobstore` scanning and assigned it to a specific `blobstore` defender after the release of 32.04, you are required to manually edit the configurations and change it to a newly created `blobstore` defender scanner. This release will also introduce a new tile support - jammy for TAS.
