[#upgrade]
=== Upgrade from Previous Releases

[#upgrade-defender]
==== Upgrade Defender Versions

With the v32.xx release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported (n, n-1, and n-2) Defender versions] are v32.xx, v31.xx, and v30.xx. Defender versions below v30.xx such as v22.12 cannot connect to the current version.

//To prepare for this update, upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.06` (Kepler) or earlier to a later version.

==== Upcoming Defender Obsolescence

With the upcoming v33.00 release, release v30.xx defenders will be obsolete. To prepare for this upcoming update, plan to upgrade defenders to release v31.xx or later.

[#upgrade-console]
==== Upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console

With the v32.xx release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported (n, n-1, and n-2) Console versions] are v32.xx, v31.xx, and v30.xx.  For example: for the current (n) major release v32.xx, the supported n-1 and n-2 versions are v31.xx and v30.xx respectively.

You can upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console from a major release to the next major release, but not to a major release that follows the next. So, to upgrade from the v30.xx release to the v32.xx release, you will have to first upgrade to v31.xx and then upgrade to the v32.xx release.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Support for Azure Container Registry and VM image scanning*
//CWP-57626
|Prisma Cloud now supports scanning Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Virtual Machine (VM) images for Azure cloud accounts that are onboarded directly through the platform.

|*A new registry scan status*
//CWP-60158

|A new status, *Partially Completed*, has been added to the scan statuses for registry scans. This status is assigned when at least one image has been successfully scanned in the registry.

The Partially Completed status appears as follows during the registry scan: 

image::../_graphics/partially_completed.png[width="50px"]

It also displays the number of images that have been scanned successfully.

//CWP-57873
|*Fixed False Positives Caused by RPM and Third-Party Package Name Discrepancies*
|Addressed the issue of false positives during vulnerability assessment  due discrepancies between RPM package names, , and third-party package names where the same CVE may be listed under different names for example, `urllib3` for Python versus `python3-urllib3` for RPM. This inconsistency led to potential false positives or missed vulnerabilities. In order to validate if the third-party package should be reported, Prisma Cloud now also assesses the origin package name.

//CWP-51958
|*Improved parsing of Jenkins Security Advisory for Fix Versions*
|Corrected parsing of Jenkins security information in affected versions and fix versions due to a scheme change. For example, the Jenkins Security Advisory 2021-10-06 did not produce fixed versions, showing all versions as vulnerable  despite CVE-2014-3577 being fixed up to and including version 2.314.

//CWP-57317
|*Fixed incorrect Image Name Retrieval for Non-RPM Containers in Openshift Clusters*
|Addressed an issue with Openshift cluster where incorrect image names were fetched for non RPM container images due to the cluster having a generic name for example, openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev. To resolve this, the mapping extracts the release and version from image labels and adjusts the name by combining registry, origin name, release, and version to be the image name. For example `<registry>/<image_name>:<version>-<release>`.

//CWP-40044
|*Support for FIPS-enabled OpenSSL packages*
|Previously, Prisma Cloud skipped scanning Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)-enabled OpenSSL packages to avoid overriding older releases, and instead matched against non-FIPS versions. This led to inaccurate vulnerability reporting.

This issue has been fixed. Prisma Cloud now fully supports scanning FIPS-enabled OpenSSL versions, ensuring correct vulnerability detection and eliminating false positives.

//CWP-49983
|*Errors added to Console log when scanning images by Defender*
|Previously, errors encountered during image scans by Defender were not added to the console log. 

This issue has been fixed. Now, when Defender scans images, error messages are printed to the console log along with the image ID and the name of the Defender.

|*[Container dump API] Allow to include labels for each container*
|A new optional query parameter `includeLabels` is added to the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cwpp/get-containers-download/[Download Container Scan Results] API. This change will add all the labels corresponding to each container in the API response.

|*Ruby Pessimistic version constraint rules are not merged correctly with other rule ranges causing FPs*
|Previously, Prisma Cloud did not handle cases involving unaffected and patched Ruby version ranges correctly. Additionally, cases, where patched Ruby version ranges, were included within unaffected Ruby versions using the pessimistic version constraint (~>),  those cases were also not handled correctly. 
This issue has been resolved.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Enhancement to Photon OS and Amazon Linux OS Feeds*
//CWP-59772
|Prisma Cloud now parses Photon OS and Amazon Linux OS feeds using CVE IDs as the primary vulnerability identifier instead of advisory IDs. 

This change enhances Prisma Cloud’s ability to correlate third-party data, and use vendor-provided information, including backports, severity assessments, and vulnerability scores.


//CWP-57783
| *[Vulnerabilities]: Severity mapping should be consistent to 4 severities: Low/Medium/High/Critical*

| All the current vendor defined severity values for the Intelligence stream are mapped into 4 predefined normalized values “Low”, “Medium”,“ High”, and “Critical”.

Note: The severity values are already normalized to create rules, the current change is only specific to the severity reporting name change.

For more information, visit https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/runtime-security/vulnerability-management/cvss-scoring#mappings[CVSS Scoring].

Note: All the unrecognized severity values from the different feeds will be assigned according to NVD severity.

=== Deprecation Notices
==== End of Support for Debian 10 (Buster)
//CWP-60870
Debian 10 (Buster) reached end-of-life on June 30, 2024. Starting from July 2024, the Debian Long Term Support (LTS) team has stopped providing security information for Debian 10. Consequently, vulnerabilities related to Debian 10 (Buster) were removed from the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream. Customers using Debian Buster (LTS or ELTS) will no longer see vulnerability data for this version.
