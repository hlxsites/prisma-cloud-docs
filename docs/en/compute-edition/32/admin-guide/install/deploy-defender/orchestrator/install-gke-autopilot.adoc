== Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot

You can now install the Prisma Cloud DaemonSet Defender on your GKE Autopilot cluster. GKE Autopilot clusters use https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/using-containerd[COS] (Container-Optimized OS) with Containerd nodes, therefore the DaemonSet must be configured with *Containerd*. Defenders deployed on GKE Autopilot clusters only support the official Prisma Cloud registry, and you cannot use a custom registry. The DaemonSet image must adhere to the following regex to ensure it comes from the official repository:

[source]
----
^registry-auth\\.twistlock\\.com/.*/twistlock/defender.*.
----

To ensure a successful deployment, do not modify the volume mounts or capabilities from the generated YAML. Any changes may cause issues with GCP allow list and deployment in GKE Autopilot.

=== Prerequisites

GKE Autopilot does not natively support DaemonSet scaling. In case of resource exhaustion or insufficient resources, Defender pods may not start. To mitigate this, consider configuring a *PriorityClass* to prioritize Defender pods. Here are the steps for mitigation:

[.procedure]

. Create a PriorityClass YAML to prioritize the Defender pods:
+
[source]
----
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: pcc-defender-ds
value: 1000000000
globalDefault: false
description: "Deploy defender daemonset"
----
+
Apply it to your cluster:
+
[source]
----
kubectl apply -f pc.yaml
----

. Reference the PriorityClass in the DaemonSet YAML under `/spec/template/spec`:
+
[source]
----
priorityClassName: pcc-defender-ds
----

This will prioritize the Defender pods over other workloads in the cluster.

Here are the steps to deploy the Prisma Cloud DaemonSet Defender on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot.

=== Deploy Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot.

Here are the steps to deploy the Prisma Cloud DaemonSet Defender on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot.

[.procedure]

. Review the prerequisites and the procedure in the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and the Install Prisma Cloud on a CRI (non-Docker) cluster sections.

. Use the following twistcli command to generate the YAML file for the GKE Autopilot deployment.
+
[source]
----
   $ <PLATFORM>/twistcli defender export kubernetes \
    --gke-autopilot \
    --container-runtime containerd \
    --cluster-address <console address> \
    --address https://<console address>:443
----
+
* The `--gke autopilot flag` adds the `'autopilot.gke.io/no-connect: "true"â€™ `annotation to the YAML file.
* The  `--container-runtime containerd` flag ensures compatibility with GKE Autopilot clusters by using the Container-Optimized OS with the containerd node image (instead of Docker). This also removes the `/var/lib/containers` mount, which is not required for GKE Autopilot.

If you are on Prisma Cloud console, from *Runtime Security > Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders > Manual deploy* ensure that the orchestrator type is *Kubernetes*, select the *Container Runtime type* as Containerd and from *Advanced Settings* enable *GKE Autopilot deployment*.

. Create the twistlock namespace on your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source]
----
$ kubectl create namespace twistlock
----

. Deploy the updated YAML or the Helm chart on your GKE Autopilot cluster.

. Verify that the Defenders are deployed.

After a few minutes, verify that the Defenders are deployed. You should observe the nodes and running containers in the Console, confirming that Prisma Cloud Compute is now protecting your cluster.
